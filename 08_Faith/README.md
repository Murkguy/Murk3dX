# FAITH: THE COVENANT
**"The silence of the Gods is not an absence. It is a test."**

Faith in *The Murk* is not a weapon; it is a shield. While Esoterists tear the world apart with alien calculations, Acolytes hold it together with sheer Will. Your power does not manifest as fireballs. It manifests as **Providence**. The bullet misses; the wound closes; the shadow retreats.

---

## 1. THE DEVOTION DIE
Your connection to the Divine is measured by your **DEVOTION DIE**.
* **Starting Value:** **d6**.
* **Progression:** You can step this up (d8, d10, d12) by spending Potential (XP).
* **Function:** This determines your Maximum Favor cap and the size of the dice you roll when praying.

---

## 2. THE HOLY BAROMETER (FAVOR)
Favor is a living resource. It fluctuates based on your conduct.

### A. THE MORNING PRAYER (STARTING FAVOR)
At the start of every Episode (or after a long downtime), roll your **DEVOTION DIE**.
* **The Result:** This is your **Starting Favor** for the session.
* **Interpretation:** A low roll implies a spiritual distance ("The Silence"). A high roll implies you are filled with holy purpose.

### B. THE TENETS (GAINING FAVOR)
You regenerate Favor by acting in accordance with your Patron's nature.
* **Trigger:** Whenever you fulfill a Tenet of your God in a significant, risky, or dramatic way.
* **Effect:** Gain **+1 Favor**.
* **Cap:** Your Favor can never exceed the max value of your Devotion Die (e.g., 6 for a d6).

### C. THE TRANSGRESSIONS (LOSING FAVOR)
* **Trigger:** Whenever you violate the nature of your Patron (Cowardice, Greed, Cruelty—depending on the God).
* **Effect:** Lose **1 Favor** immediately.

### D. THE HOLLOW STATE
When your Favor drops to **0**, you are **Hollow**.
* **The Risk:** If you commit a Transgression while at 0 Favor, you break the Covenant.
* **The Penalty:** You take **d6 Stress (Guilt)** immediately.
* **The Condition:** You become **Forsaken**. You cannot gain Favor or use Miracles until you perform a significant Atonement (a narrative quest or sacrifice).

## 3. THE PETITION (THE MECHANIC)
Miracles are not guaranteed. You must ask, and the Gods must choose to answer.

**THE LAW OF AMBIGUITY:**
A Petition must always be explainable as luck, fate, or coincidence. If you ask for physics to break (e.g., "I want to fly"), the Petition fails automatically.

### HOW TO PETITION
**Step 1: State your Intent.** ("I want the guard to look away," "I want this door to be unlocked.")
**Step 2: The Director sets the Threshold.** (How improbable is this?)
**Step 3: The Offering.** Spend **X Favor**.
**Step 4: The Roll.** Roll **X Devotion Dice** (Equal to the Favor spent).
**Step 5: The Outcome.** Sum the total.

| INTENT DIFFICULTY | THRESHOLD (TN) | EXAMPLE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Nudge** | **5+** | A rusty lock breaks; a guard gets distracted; you find ammo. |
| **The Stroke of Luck** | **10+** | A beam collapses on an enemy; a disease goes into remission; a beast ignores you. |
| **The Intervention** | **15+** | You survive a lethal fall; an entire squad panics; a sudden storm covers your escape. |

* **Success:** The Miracle occurs. You narrate how it looks like a coincidence.
* **Failure:** The Silence. The Favor is lost, and nothing happens.
