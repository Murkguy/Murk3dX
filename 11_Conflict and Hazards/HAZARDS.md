## 4. HAZARDS (THE ENVIRONMENT)
The world is trying to kill you just as hard as the monsters are.

### THE MURK (See Chapter 8)
* **Exposure:** Entering unprotected deep Murk requires a **Body Save (DR 12)**.
    * *Failure:* Take **1 Rank of Suffering** (Lung Rot).
* **The Whisper:** Staring into the fog requires a **Mind Save (DR 12)**.
    * *Failure:* Take **d4 Stress**.

### FALLING
* **Short Fall (1 Story):** 6 Stress. (Save BODY for half).
* **Long Fall (2-3 Stories):** 12 Stress. (Save BODY for half).
* **Terminal Fall:** Death or Critical Injury (Table B) immediately.

### FIRE
* **Ignition:** If set on fire, take **4 Stress** at the start of every turn.
* **Extinguish:** Requires an Action (Stop, Drop, and Roll).

### SUFFOCATION
* **Gas/Water:** You can hold your breath for **Body Die** rounds.
* **Failure:** Once air runs out, take **d6 Direct Stress** per round (Ignores Armor). If you Break, you drown.

# CHAPTER 4: HEALTH & SUFFERING

In *The Murk*, survival is a measure of endurance. Every blow, every scare, and every dark whisper adds weight to your character's shoulders. Eventually, the weight becomes too much.

---

## 1. THE STRESS TRACK (THE UNIVERSAL THRESHOLD)
There are no separate health bars. There is only **Stress**.

* **Starts at 0:** At the beginning of every Scene.
* **Accumulates:** Every source of damage (bullets, claws, fear, magic) adds to this single total.
* **The Logic:** A soldier who has just dodged a grenade (Physical Stress) is terrified and exhausted; he is now much more vulnerable to a psychic attack than a fresh soldier.

---

## 2. TAKING DAMAGE (THE ROLL)

### STEP 1: THE IMPACT
The GM rolls damage for the attack (e.g., 4 Damage).
* **Add this number to your current Stress Track.**
* *Example:* You had 5 Stress. You take 4 Damage. Your Stress is now 9.

### STEP 2: THE SAVE (THE STRUGGLE)
You must roll your **Attribute Die** to see if you can hold it together against the new total.

* **The Attribute:** Determined by the source of the latest hit.
    * *Bullet/Claw:* Roll **BODY**.
    * *Fear/Confusion:* Roll **MIND**.
    * *Magic/Corruption:* Roll **SPIRIT**.
* **The Target:** You must roll **OVER** your current Stress Track number.
* **Exploding Dice:** If you roll the max number on your die, roll again and add it.

### STEP 3: THE RESULT
* **SUCCESS (Roll > Stress):**
    * **"Shrugged Off."** You grit your teeth. You are hurt/scared, but you are still fighting.
    * **The Stress Remains:** Your Stress Track stays at the high number (e.g., 9). The next hit will be even harder to resist.
    * *Tactical Note:* If your Stress is high, you are vulnerable. You need to end the fight or retreat to let it clear.

* **FAILURE (Roll ≤ Stress):**
    * **"The Wound."** Your defenses collapse.
    * **Effect:** Take **1 Rank of SUFFERING**.
    * **The Stress Clears:** The immediate adrenaline dumps. Reset your Stress Track to **0**. (You have taken the wound, the tension is released, and the cycle begins again).

---

## 3. SUFFERING (THE DEATH SPIRAL)
When you fail a Stress Save, you take real, lasting trauma. The type of Suffering depends on what hit you, but the penalty is universal.

### THE PENALTY (-1)
**Each Rank of Suffering imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to ALL rolls.**
* This applies to Attacks, Skills, and future Stress Saves.
* *The more you suffer, the likely you are to suffer more.*

### FLAVOR OF SUFFERING (Optional)
While the mechanic is the same, the narrative changes:
* **Body Failure:** Broken ribs, gouged eye, punctured lung.
* **Mind Failure:** Panic attack, catatonia, tremors.
* **Spirit Failure:** Necrotic veins, whispering voices, sudden aging.

---

## 4. THE BREAKDOWN (THE END)
The breaking point is not determined by a fixed number of HP, but by the volatility of your Suffering.

* **WHEN TO ROLL:** Immediately upon taking a new Rank of Suffering.
* **THE ROLL:** Roll **1d6 for every Rank of Suffering** you currently possess.
    * *Example:* If you just took your 3rd Rank, roll 3d6.

### THE THRESHOLD: Sum the dice.
* **Total ≤ 20:** You are broken, bleeding, and terrified, but you are still a PC.
* **Total > 20:** **YOU BREAK.**

### THE BREAK STATE
Your character is done. They become an NPC/Unplayable at the end of the current scene.
* **Option A: The Fall.** You collapse. If your party drags you out, you survive as a retired NPC or require massive downtime/surgery to return.
* **Option B: Blaze of Glory.**
    * State your intent.
    * Roll a **d20**.
    * **11+:** It happens exactly as you said. You die a hero, changing the story forever.
    * **10-:** You die a victim of the Murk.

---

## 5. THE MANIFESTATION OF SUFFERING
When you take a Rank of Suffering, the math gets harder (-1 Penalty), but the story gets worse. You must roll (or choose) a specific Debility that restricts how your character interacts with the world.

* **Rank 1 & 2:** Roll on Table A (The Hinderance).
* **Rank 3+:** Roll on Table B (The Critical).

### A. PHYSICAL SUFFERING (Broken Bodies)
*The body is a machine, and yours is breaking down.*

#### TABLE A: THE HINDERANCE (Rank 1 & 2)
| Roll | Debility | Narrative Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Concussed** | Your vision swims. You cannot read text, decipher codes, or focus on distant targets. |
| **2** | **Weak Grip** | Your hands are slick or numb. If you take any Stress, you immediately drop whatever you are holding. |
| **3** | **Bad Leg** | You are the slowest in the group. In a chase, you are automatically the one caught unless someone carries you. |
| **4** | **Winded** | Every breath hurts. You cannot hold your breath, making gas masks suffocating and stealth impossible if you are moving. |
| **5** | **Bleeding** | You leave a trail. You cannot hide; enemies can track you by scent and sight automatically. |
| **6** | **Swollen Eye** | You have a blind side. Enemies attacking from your Left (or Right) are effectively invisible to you until they strike. |

#### TABLE B: THE CRITICAL (Rank 3+)
| Roll | Debility | Narrative Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Useless Limb** | A bone snaps or a muscle tears. One arm or leg hangs dead. You are one-handed, or you must hop/crawl. |
| **2** | **Coughing Blood** | You are drowning internally. You make noise constantly. Stealth is impossible, and you cannot sleep. |
| **3** | **Deep Shock** | Your body shuts down. You cannot act in a scene until an ally physically shakes or strikes you to wake you up. |
| **4** | **Ruptured Ear** | The world is muffled ringing. You are deaf. Communication requires line-of-sight and hand signals. |
| **5** | **Tremors** | Uncontrollable spasms. You cannot perform fine motor tasks (picking locks, typing, performing surgery). |
| **6** | **Horrific** | The wound is gruesome. Civilians will flee or vomit rather than speak to you. You are a walking monster. |

### B. MENTAL SUFFERING (Broken Minds)
*The mind is a fortress, and the walls are crumbling.*

#### TABLE A: THE HINDERANCE (Rank 1 & 2)
| Roll | Debility | Narrative Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **The Shakes** | Adrenaline overload. You cannot keep your hands steady. You cannot aim rifles or perform delicate work. |
| **2** | **Tunnel Vision** | You obsess over the immediate threat. You notice nothing else (loot, traps, allies) unless it is right in front of your face. |
| **3** | **Hesitation** | You second-guess every instinct. You cannot strike first; you must always wait for the enemy to act before you react. |
| **4** | **Paranoia** | You trust no one. You refuse to let allies touch you, heal you, or hand you items. |
| **5** | **Mute** | You go non-verbal. You cannot speak, shout warnings, or cast spells that require incantations. |
| **6** | **Shadow-Blight** | You see shapes in the dark. You cannot enter a dark room or unlit area alone. |

#### TABLE B: THE BREAK (Rank 3+)
| Roll | Debility | Narrative Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Death Wish** | You stop caring if you live. You refuse to retreat, take cover, or hide. You stand in the open. |
| **2** | **Manic** | You cannot control your volume. You laugh, cry, or scream at inappropriate times. Stealth is ruined. |
| **3** | **Triggered** | A specific stimulus (fire, fog, a sound) freezes you. If you encounter it, you lose your turn entirely. |
| **4** | **Hollow** | You feel nothing. You cannot use Spirit or Magic at all. The spark is gone. |
| **5** | **Murk-Touched** | The Fog recognizes you. Normal animals attack you on sight; Murk-beasts may ignore you, thinking you are one of them. |
| **6** | **Incoherent** | Your logic centers fail. You cannot articulate plans, explain mechanisms, or give orders. |

## 4. RECOVERY (THE LONG ROAD)

### THE EPISODE RULE
Suffering does not reset overnight. At the end of an Episode (a full session or completed mission), you remove **1 Rank of Suffering**.

### LAST IN, FIRST OUT
You heal the worst injuries first, but the minor aches linger.
* **Example:** You have Rank 3 (Useless Limb) and Rank 2 (Bleeding).
* **Recovery:** You remove Rank 3. Your arm works again (The bone is set), but you are still Bleeding (Rank 2) and suffer the penalty for the next Episode.

### MEDICAL INTERVENTION
A Doctor or Healer can attempt to treat a specific debility during downtime.
* **The Check:** An Intellect/Spirit check.
* **Success:** A "Critical" debility (Table B) is downgraded to a "Hinderance" (Table A). The Suffering Rank remains, but the narrative constraint becomes less severe.
* **Failure:** The patient takes Stress from the pain.
