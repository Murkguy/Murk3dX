# CHAPTER 6: SOCIAL DYNAMICS

In a world where civilization has collapsed, words are often the only thing standing between you and a shallow grave. Social interaction is handled in two phases: **Passive Disposition** (How they react to you) and **Active Influence** (What you can make them do).

---

## 1. DISPOSITION (THE VIBE CHECK)
When you enter a settlement or encounter a neutral faction, the **Lead Character** (usually the one speaking first or walking point) makes a **Spirit Check**. This sets the "weather" for the encounter.

### THE DIFFICULTY
* **DR 10:** Desperate Refugees / Standard Traders.
* **DR 15:** Wary Guards / Xenophobic Villagers.
* **DR 20:** Religious Zealots / Hostile Gangs.

### THE OUTCOME
* **Failure (Hostile):** They see you as a threat or prey.
    * *Effect:* Prices are **+25%**. They will not share rumors. Weapons must be sheathed.
* **Success (Neutral):** They see you as travelers.
    * *Effect:* Standard prices. They will trade information for Barter.
* **Success by 5+ (Friendly):** They see you as allies or saviors.
    * *Effect:* Prices are Standard. You gain **Advantage** on the first Parley Check you make. A local may offer a free safehouse.

## 2. INFLUENCE (SKILL CHECKS)
To actively change an NPC's mind, tell a lie, or negotiate a deal, you use your **Spirit Skills**.

### PARLEY (Persuasion / Deception)
* **Used for:** Lying, haggling, convincing, or calming.
* **The Rule:** You cannot Parley with someone who is **Hostile** unless you offer a significant bribe or gesture of goodwill first.

### INTIMIDATION (Threats)
* **Used for:** Interrogation, robbery, or forcing a retreat.
* **The Rule:** Intimidation is risky. On a **Failure**, the target does not just refuse; they **escalate**. A terrified shopkeeper might pull a shotgun; a guard might sound the alarm.

### INSIGHT (Reading People)
* **Used for:** Detecting lies, sensing emotional states.
* **The Rule:** Roll **Insight vs Target's Spirit Die**.
    * **Success:** You learn their **Disposition** (if hidden) or one specific **Desire/Fear**.
    * **Note:** Knowing a Target's Desire gives you **+2** on your next Parley roll against them.

## 3. SOCIAL CONFLICT (VERBAL WARFARE)
Sometimes, one roll isn't enough. When the stakes are high (a trial, a high-stakes negotiation, an interrogation), you enter **Social Conflict**.

*This functions exactly like Combat, but you use Words as Weapons.*

### THE MECHANIC
* **Initiative:** Roll Spirit.
* **Attack:** Roll **Parley** or **Intimidation** vs the Target's **Spirit Defense** (10 + Spirit Die).
* **Damage:** If you hit, you inflict **Stress** on the Target.
* **Defense:** The Target rolls a **Spirit Save** to resist the Stress.

### SOCIAL "WEAPONS"
*Just as a Knife deals 1d4, your arguments have weight based on their leverage.*

| Argument Type | Damage (Stress) | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic / Flattery** | **1d4** | "It's a good deal." "You look nice today." |
| **Lies / Bribes** | **1d6** | "I am a Prince of Kemet." "Here is 100 Bar
