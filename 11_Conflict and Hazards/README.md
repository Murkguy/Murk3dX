# CHAPTER 3: CONFLICT & HAZARDS

In *The Murk*, violence is not a duel; it is a frantic scramble in the dark. You do not trade blows; you trade opportunities to kill.

---

## 1. INITIATIVE (THE MOMENT OF ACTION)
Combat does not happen in a vacuum. It happens when the tension snaps. In this game, you do not roll a generic "Speed" stat. You roll the Attribute that defines how you process danger.

### THE ROLL
* **The Soldier rolls Tactics (d8):** Reading the battlefield geometry.
* **The Ruffian rolls Guile (d8):** Acting on gut instinct and panic.
* **The Esoterist rolls Arcana (d8):** Sensing the shift in energy.
* **The Acolyte rolls Devotion (d8):** Divine premonition.
* **Universal:** If you lack a Unique Attribute (or choose not to use it), roll **MIND**.

**Formula:** `2d6 + Attribute Die`

### THE SLOT SYSTEM
Do not track specific numbers (e.g., 17 vs 16). Group results into Time Slots.

* **THE BLITZ (20+):** You are moving faster than thought. You act **First**, before the Environment or the Enemy.
* **THE FAST (15-19):** You act before Standard Enemies.
* **THE FRAY (10-14):** You act simultaneously with Standard Enemies. (The Players choose who goes first in ties, or the Director alternates).
* **THE SLOW (<10):** You act **Last**. You are suppressing panic, clearing a jam, or simply hesitated.

### THE OUTPACE BONUS
Speed kills. If your Initiative Slot is **Higher** than your target's Slot (e.g., You are Fast and they are Slow):
1.  You act before them.
2.  **The Opening:** You gain **+1d6** to your first Attack or Action against them. You caught them flat-footed.

---

## 2. THE TURN (THE EXCHANGE)
On your turn, you may **Move** and take **One Significant Action**.

### MOVE
* **Standard:** Move up to **Near Range** (approx. 30ft/10m).
* **Rush:** You may forgo your Action to Move up to **Far Range**.

### SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS
* **ATTACK:**
    * **Melee:** Roll `2d6 + BODY`.
    * **Ranged:** Roll `2d6 + MIND` (or Body for Heavy Weapons).
    * **Target:** Compare Result vs. Enemy Defense Rating (DR).
* **CAST (Esoterist):**
    * Roll **1d4 Stress** to charge the spell. (No roll to hit unless the spell specifies otherwise).
* **MANEUVER:**
    * Use an Archetype Ability (e.g., Soldier's Suppressing Fire, Ruffian's Pocket Sand).
* **RECOVER (Regroup):**
    * You take a moment to breathe, un-jam your gun, or center your mind.
    * **Effect:** Remove **d4 Stress** from your track.
    * **Note:** You cannot do this if you are engaged in Melee unless an ally protects you.

### REACTIONS
You do not have a "Reaction Action" by default. However, you may spend **Potential** to react out of turn.
* **Dodge/Parry:** Spend **2 Potential** to increase your Defense Rating by **+2** against a single attack.
* **Intervene:** Spend **2 Potential** to jump in front of an attack meant for an ally (Taking the Stress yourself).

---

## 3. RANGES (THE GEOMETRY OF FOG)
Precise grids do not exist in the Murk. Distance is measured by clarity.

* **CLOSE (Melee):** Arm’s reach. You can touch them. Ranged weapons have **Disadvantage** here (unless Pistol/CQB).
* **NEAR (Thrown):** The width of a large room or a street. You can throw a grenade or shout a command. Visibility is usually clear.
* **FAR (Rifle):** Shouting distance. The edge of visibility.
    * **The Murk Rule:** In heavy fog, Far Range is effectively blind. Attacks are made at **Disadvantage** or are impossible without thermal/magical aid.

---

## 4. HAZARDS (THE ENVIRONMENT)
The world is trying to kill you just as hard as the monsters are.

### THE MURK (See Chapter 8)
* **Exposure:** Entering unprotected deep Murk requires a **Body Save (DR 12)**.
    * *Failure:* Take **1 Rank of Suffering** (Lung Rot).
* **The Whisper:** Staring into the fog requires a **Mind Save (DR 12)**.
    * *Failure:* Take **d4 Stress**.

### FALLING
* **Short Fall (1 Story):** 6 Stress. (Save BODY for half).
* **Long Fall (2-3 Stories):** 12 Stress. (Save BODY for half).
* **Terminal Fall:** Death or Critical Injury (Table B) immediately.

### FIRE
* **Ignition:** If set on fire, take **4 Stress** at the start of every turn.
* **Extinguish:** Requires an Action (Stop, Drop, and Roll).

### SUFFOCATION
* **Gas/Water:** You can hold your breath for **Body Die** rounds.
* **Failure:** Once air runs out, take **d6 Direct Stress** per round (Ignores Armor). If you Break, you drown.

# CHAPTER 4: HEALTH & SUFFERING

In *The Murk*, survival is a measure of endurance. Every blow, every scare, and every dark whisper adds weight to your character's shoulders. Eventually, the weight becomes too much.

---

## 1. THE STRESS TRACK (THE UNIVERSAL THRESHOLD)
There are no separate health bars. There is only **Stress**.

* **Starts at 0:** At the beginning of every Scene.
* **Accumulates:** Every source of damage (bullets, claws, fear, magic) adds to this single total.
* **The Logic:** A soldier who has just dodged a grenade (Physical Stress) is terrified and exhausted; he is now much more vulnerable to a psychic attack than a fresh soldier.

---

## 2. TAKING DAMAGE (THE ROLL)

### STEP 1: THE IMPACT
The GM rolls damage for the attack (e.g., 4 Damage).
* **Add this number to your current Stress Track.**
* *Example:* You had 5 Stress. You take 4 Damage. Your Stress is now 9.

### STEP 2: THE SAVE (THE STRUGGLE)
You must roll your **Attribute Die** to see if you can hold it together against the new total.

* **The Attribute:** Determined by the source of the latest hit.
    * *Bullet/Claw:* Roll **BODY**.
    * *Fear/Confusion:* Roll **MIND**.
    * *Magic/Corruption:* Roll **SPIRIT**.
* **The Target:** You must roll **OVER** your current Stress Track number.
* **Exploding Dice:** If you roll the max number on your die, roll again and add it.

### STEP 3: THE RESULT
* **SUCCESS (Roll > Stress):**
    * **"Shrugged Off."** You grit your teeth. You are hurt/scared, but you are still fighting.
    * **The Stress Remains:** Your Stress Track stays at the high number (e.g., 9). The next hit will be even harder to resist.
    * *Tactical Note:* If your Stress is high, you are vulnerable. You need to end the fight or retreat to let it clear.

* **FAILURE (Roll ≤ Stress):**
    * **"The Wound."** Your defenses collapse.
    * **Effect:** Take **1 Rank of SUFFERING**.
    * **The Stress Clears:** The immediate adrenaline dumps. Reset your Stress Track to **0**. (You have taken the wound, the tension is released, and the cycle begins again).

---

## 3. SUFFERING (THE DEATH SPIRAL)
When you fail a Stress Save, you take real, lasting trauma. The type of Suffering depends on what hit you, but the penalty is universal.

### THE PENALTY (-1)
**Each Rank of Suffering imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to ALL rolls.**
* This applies to Attacks, Skills, and future Stress Saves.
* *The more you suffer, the likely you are to suffer more.*

### FLAVOR OF SUFFERING (Optional)
While the mechanic is the same, the narrative changes:
* **Body Failure:** Broken ribs, gouged eye, punctured lung.
* **Mind Failure:** Panic attack, catatonia, tremors.
* **Spirit Failure:** Necrotic veins, whispering voices, sudden aging.

---

## 4. THE BREAKDOWN (THE END)
The breaking point is not determined by a fixed number of HP, but by the volatility of your Suffering.

* **WHEN TO ROLL:** Immediately upon taking a new Rank of Suffering.
* **THE ROLL:** Roll **1d6 for every Rank of Suffering** you currently possess.
    * *Example:* If you just took your 3rd Rank, roll 3d6.

### THE THRESHOLD: Sum the dice.
* **Total ≤ 20:** You are broken, bleeding, and terrified, but you are still a PC.
* **Total > 20:** **YOU BREAK.**

### THE BREAK STATE
Your character is done. They become an NPC/Unplayable at the end of the current scene.
* **Option A: The Fall.** You collapse. If your party drags you out, you survive as a retired NPC or require massive downtime/surgery to return.
* **Option B: Blaze of Glory.**
    * State your intent.
    * Roll a **d20**.
    * **11+:** It happens exactly as you said. You die a hero, changing the story forever.
    * **10-:** You die a victim of the Murk.

---

## 5. THE MANIFESTATION OF SUFFERING
When you take a Rank of Suffering, the math gets harder (-1 Penalty), but the story gets worse. You must roll (or choose) a specific Debility that restricts how your character interacts with the world.

* **Rank 1 & 2:** Roll on Table A (The Hinderance).
* **Rank 3+:** Roll on Table B (The Critical).

### A. PHYSICAL SUFFERING (Broken Bodies)
*The body is a machine, and yours is breaking down.*

#### TABLE A: THE HINDERANCE (Rank 1 & 2)
| Roll | Debility | Narrative Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Concussed** | Your vision swims. You cannot read text, decipher codes, or focus on distant targets. |
| **2** | **Weak Grip** | Your hands are slick or numb. If you take any Stress, you immediately drop whatever you are holding. |
| **3** | **Bad Leg** | You are the slowest in the group. In a chase, you are automatically the one caught unless someone carries you. |
| **4** | **Winded** | Every breath hurts. You cannot hold your breath, making gas masks suffocating and stealth impossible if you are moving. |
| **5** | **Bleeding** | You leave a trail. You cannot hide; enemies can track you by scent and sight automatically. |
| **6** | **Swollen Eye** | You have a blind side. Enemies attacking from your Left (or Right) are effectively invisible to you until they strike. |

#### TABLE B: THE CRITICAL (Rank 3+)
| Roll | Debility | Narrative Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Useless Limb** | A bone snaps or a muscle tears. One arm or leg hangs dead. You are one-handed, or you must hop/crawl. |
| **2** | **Coughing Blood** | You are drowning internally. You make noise constantly. Stealth is impossible, and you cannot sleep. |
| **3** | **Deep Shock** | Your body shuts down. You cannot act in a scene until an ally physically shakes or strikes you to wake you up. |
| **4** | **Ruptured Ear** | The world is muffled ringing. You are deaf. Communication requires line-of-sight and hand signals. |
| **5** | **Tremors** | Uncontrollable spasms. You cannot perform fine motor tasks (picking locks, typing, performing surgery). |
| **6** | **Horrific** | The wound is gruesome. Civilians will flee or vomit rather than speak to you. You are a walking monster. |

### B. MENTAL SUFFERING (Broken Minds)
*The mind is a fortress, and the walls are crumbling.*

#### TABLE A: THE HINDERANCE (Rank 1 & 2)
| Roll | Debility | Narrative Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **The Shakes** | Adrenaline overload. You cannot keep your hands steady. You cannot aim rifles or perform delicate work. |
| **2** | **Tunnel Vision** | You obsess over the immediate threat. You notice nothing else (loot, traps, allies) unless it is right in front of your face. |
| **3** | **Hesitation** | You second-guess every instinct. You cannot strike first; you must always wait for the enemy to act before you react. |
| **4** | **Paranoia** | You trust no one. You refuse to let allies touch you, heal you, or hand you items. |
| **5** | **Mute** | You go non-verbal. You cannot speak, shout warnings, or cast spells that require incantations. |
| **6** | **Shadow-Blight** | You see shapes in the dark. You cannot enter a dark room or unlit area alone. |

#### TABLE B: THE BREAK (Rank 3+)
| Roll | Debility | Narrative Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Death Wish** | You stop caring if you live. You refuse to retreat, take cover, or hide. You stand in the open. |
| **2** | **Manic** | You cannot control your volume. You laugh, cry, or scream at inappropriate times. Stealth is ruined. |
| **3** | **Triggered** | A specific stimulus (fire, fog, a sound) freezes you. If you encounter it, you lose your turn entirely. |
| **4** | **Hollow** | You feel nothing. You cannot use Spirit or Magic at all. The spark is gone. |
| **5** | **Murk-Touched** | The Fog recognizes you. Normal animals attack you on sight; Murk-beasts may ignore you, thinking you are one of them. |
| **6** | **Incoherent** | Your logic centers fail. You cannot articulate plans, explain mechanisms, or give orders. |

---

## 4. RECOVERY (THE LONG ROAD)

### THE EPISODE RULE
Suffering does not reset overnight. At the end of an Episode (a full session or completed mission), you remove **1 Rank of Suffering**.

### LAST IN, FIRST OUT
You heal the worst injuries first, but the minor aches linger.
* **Example:** You have Rank 3 (Useless Limb) and Rank 2 (Bleeding).
* **Recovery:** You remove Rank 3. Your arm works again (The bone is set), but you are still Bleeding (Rank 2) and suffer the penalty for the next Episode.

### MEDICAL INTERVENTION
A Doctor or Healer can attempt to treat a specific debility during downtime.
* **The Check:** An Intellect/Spirit check.
* **Success:** A "Critical" debility (Table B) is downgraded to a "Hinderance" (Table A). The Suffering Rank remains, but the narrative constraint becomes less severe.
* **Failure:** The patient takes Stress from the pain.

# CHAPTER 6: SOCIAL DYNAMICS

In a world where civilization has collapsed, words are often the only thing standing between you and a shallow grave. Social interaction is handled in two phases: **Passive Disposition** (How they react to you) and **Active Influence** (What you can make them do).

---

## 1. DISPOSITION (THE VIBE CHECK)
When you enter a settlement or encounter a neutral faction, the **Lead Character** (usually the one speaking first or walking point) makes a **Spirit Check**. This sets the "weather" for the encounter.

### THE DIFFICULTY
* **DR 10:** Desperate Refugees / Standard Traders.
* **DR 15:** Wary Guards / Xenophobic Villagers.
* **DR 20:** Religious Zealots / Hostile Gangs.

### THE OUTCOME
* **Failure (Hostile):** They see you as a threat or prey.
    * *Effect:* Prices are **+25%**. They will not share rumors. Weapons must be sheathed.
* **Success (Neutral):** They see you as travelers.
    * *Effect:* Standard prices. They will trade information for Barter.
* **Success by 5+ (Friendly):** They see you as allies or saviors.
    * *Effect:* Prices are Standard. You gain **Advantage** on the first Parley Check you make. A local may offer a free safehouse.

---

## 2. INFLUENCE (SKILL CHECKS)
To actively change an NPC's mind, tell a lie, or negotiate a deal, you use your **Spirit Skills**.

### PARLEY (Persuasion / Deception)
* **Used for:** Lying, haggling, convincing, or calming.
* **The Rule:** You cannot Parley with someone who is **Hostile** unless you offer a significant bribe or gesture of goodwill first.

### INTIMIDATION (Threats)
* **Used for:** Interrogation, robbery, or forcing a retreat.
* **The Rule:** Intimidation is risky. On a **Failure**, the target does not just refuse; they **escalate**. A terrified shopkeeper might pull a shotgun; a guard might sound the alarm.

### INSIGHT (Reading People)
* **Used for:** Detecting lies, sensing emotional states.
* **The Rule:** Roll **Insight vs Target's Spirit Die**.
    * **Success:** You learn their **Disposition** (if hidden) or one specific **Desire/Fear**.
    * **Note:** Knowing a Target's Desire gives you **+2** on your next Parley roll against them.

---

## 3. SOCIAL CONFLICT (VERBAL WARFARE)
Sometimes, one roll isn't enough. When the stakes are high (a trial, a high-stakes negotiation, an interrogation), you enter **Social Conflict**.

*This functions exactly like Combat, but you use Words as Weapons.*

### THE MECHANIC
* **Initiative:** Roll Spirit.
* **Attack:** Roll **Parley** or **Intimidation** vs the Target's **Spirit Defense** (10 + Spirit Die).
* **Damage:** If you hit, you inflict **Stress** on the Target.
* **Defense:** The Target rolls a **Spirit Save** to resist the Stress.

### SOCIAL "WEAPONS"
*Just as a Knife deals 1d4, your arguments have weight based on their leverage.*

| Argument Type | Damage (Stress) | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic / Flattery** | **1d4** | "It's a good deal." "You look nice today." |
| **Lies / Bribes** | **1d6** | "I am a Prince of Kemet." "Here is 100 Bar
