# CHAPTER 3: CONFLICT & HAZARDS

In *The Murk*, violence is not a duel; it is a frantic scramble in the dark. You do not trade blows; you trade opportunities to kill.

---

## 1. INITIATIVE (THE MOMENT OF ACTION)
Combat does not happen in a vacuum. It happens when the tension snaps. In this game, you do not roll a generic "Speed" stat. You roll the Attribute that defines how you process danger.

### THE ROLL
* **The Soldier rolls Tactics (d8):** Reading the battlefield geometry.
* **The Ruffian rolls Guile (d8):** Acting on gut instinct and panic.
* **The Esoterist rolls Arcana (d8):** Sensing the shift in energy.
* **The Acolyte rolls Devotion (d8):** Divine premonition.
* **Universal:** If you lack a Unique Attribute (or choose not to use it), roll **MIND**.

**Formula:** `2d6 + Attribute Die`

### THE SLOT SYSTEM
Do not track specific numbers (e.g., 17 vs 16). Group results into Time Slots.

* **THE BLITZ (20+):** You are moving faster than thought. You act **First**, before the Environment or the Enemy.
* **THE FAST (15-19):** You act before Standard Enemies.
* **THE FRAY (10-14):** You act simultaneously with Standard Enemies. (The Players choose who goes first in ties, or the Director alternates).
* **THE SLOW (<10):** You act **Last**. You are suppressing panic, clearing a jam, or simply hesitated.

### THE OUTPACE BONUS
Speed kills. If your Initiative Slot is **Higher** than your target's Slot (e.g., You are Fast and they are Slow):
1.  You act before them.
2.  **The Opening:** You gain **+1d6** to your first Attack or Action against them. You caught them flat-footed.

## 2. THE TURN (THE EXCHANGE)
On your turn, you may **Move** and take **One Significant Action**.

### MOVE
* **Standard:** Move up to **Near Range** (approx. 30ft/10m).
* **Rush:** You may forgo your Action to Move up to **Far Range**.

### SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS
* **ATTACK:**
    * **Melee:** Roll `2d6 + BODY`.
    * **Ranged:** Roll `2d6 + MIND` (or Body for Heavy Weapons).
    * **Target:** Compare Result vs. Enemy Defense Rating (DR).
* **CAST (Esoterist):**
    * Roll **1d4 Stress** to charge the spell. (No roll to hit unless the spell specifies otherwise).
* **MANEUVER:**
    * Use an Archetype Ability (e.g., Soldier's Suppressing Fire, Ruffian's Pocket Sand).
* **RECOVER (Regroup):**
    * You take a moment to breathe, un-jam your gun, or center your mind.
    * **Effect:** Remove **d4 Stress** from your track.
    * **Note:** You cannot do this if you are engaged in Melee unless an ally protects you.

### REACTIONS
You do not have a "Reaction Action" by default. However, you may spend **Potential** to react out of turn.
* **Dodge/Parry:** Spend **2 Potential** to increase your Defense Rating by **+2** against a single attack.
* **Intervene:** Spend **2 Potential** to jump in front of an attack meant for an ally (Taking the Stress yourself).

## 3. RANGES (THE GEOMETRY OF FOG)
Precise grids do not exist in the Murk. Distance is measured by clarity.

* **CLOSE (Melee):** Arm’s reach. You can touch them. Ranged weapons have **Disadvantage** here (unless Pistol/CQB).
* **NEAR (Thrown):** The width of a large room or a street. You can throw a grenade or shout a command. Visibility is usually clear.
* **FAR (Rifle):** Shouting distance. The edge of visibility.
    * **The Murk Rule:** In heavy fog, Far Range is effectively blind. Attacks are made at **Disadvantage** or are impossible without thermal/magical aid.
