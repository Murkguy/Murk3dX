# CHAPTER 5: SKILLS

In *The Murk*, competence is the difference between breathing and rotting. Your Attributes define your raw potential, but your Skills define your training.

## 1. THE SKILL TIERS
Every skill is rated in one of three Tiers. This applies a flat modifier to your Result.

### 1. UNTRAINED (Penalty: -2)
*The Novice. You have seen it done, but you have never done it under fire.*
* **The Mechanic:** `2d6 + Attribute Die - 2`
* **Impact:** You are clumsy and hesitant. You will likely fail Standard Tasks (DR 10).

### 2. TRAINED (Bonus: +2)
*The Professional. You have done this for a living. You know the protocols.*
* **The Mechanic:** `2d6 + Attribute Die + 2`
* **Impact:** This virtually guarantees success on Standard Tasks (DR 10) and gives you a fighting chance at Hard Tasks (DR 15).

### 3. EXPERT (Bonus: +4)
*The Master. You have written books on the subject, or you are simply a savant.*
* **The Mechanic:** `2d6 + Attribute Die + 4`
* **Impact:** You are world-class. You can attempt Impossible Tasks (DR 20) with confidence.
