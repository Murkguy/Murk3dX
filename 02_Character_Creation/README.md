# CHAPTER 2: THE ARCHETYPES

In *The Murk*, your profession is not merely a job; it is a survival strategy. While the common folk cower in the Rungs, you have honed the specific talents required to walk into the fog and return with your mind and body intact.

### 0. THE BASELINE (SURVIVING STRESS)
*Before choosing Archetypes, understand how damage works.*
In this game, there is one **Stress Track**. Every source of damage—bullets, fear, magic—adds to this single number.

* **The Save:** Immediately after taking damage, you must roll to see if you can handle the new **Total Stress**.
* **The Dice Pool:** By default, you roll **3 Attribute Dice** corresponding to the source of the damage (Body, Mind, or Spirit).
* **Success:** Your Total Roll > Current Stress. You are fine.
* **Failure:** Your Total Roll ≤ Current Stress. You take a **Rank of Suffering** (and Stress resets to 0).

## 1. THE SOLDIER
**The Specialist. The Veteran. The Wall.**

The Great War technically ended years ago, but for you, the ceasefire was just a suggestion. You are a creature of discipline in a world of chaos. Whether you are a disillusioned veteran of the Vardan trench-lines, a mercenary protecting trade caravans from Murk-beasts, or an enforcer for a Merchant House, you solve problems with ballistics. While others panic at the sight of a horror, you check your magazine and calculate the firing angle. You are the line in the sand.

* **Unique Attribute:** **TACTICS (d8)**
    * *Used for:* Initiative, Threat Assessment, and tactical command.
* **Resource:** **Command Points (CP)**
    * *Generation:* At the start of Combat, roll your Tactics Die. The result is your CP Pool for that scene.

### INTRINSIC PERKS (Gain All 3)
1.  **Standard Issue:** You are trained to fight under load. You ignore the **Clumsy Tag** on Heavy Armor and Heavy Weapons. (Normally, these items apply a -2 Penalty to Movement and Stealth).
2.  **Grit:** You are a slab of iron. When making a **Body Save** against Physical Stress, you roll **4 Body Dice** (instead of 3).
    * *The Edge:* Where a civilian rolls 3d10 to beat a Stress of 15, you roll 4d10. You are significantly more likely to shrug off heavy damage without Breaking.
3.  **The Bandolier:** You are never unarmed. Once per Scene, you may spend **1 CP** to reveal that you packed a specific Combat Consumable (Grenade, Flare, Breach Charge, or Ammo Clip), even if it wasn't on your inventory sheet.

---

## 2. THE ESOTERIST
**The Researcher. The Occultist. The Volatile.**

Magic is not a miracle; it is a science that humanity has simply forgotten how to control. While the world cowers from the supernatural, you dissect it. You are a student of "Esoteria"—the dangerous intersection of ancient Vardan rituals and modern industrial theory. You might be a disgraced academic from the Palatine colleges or a field researcher clutching a book of geometries that shouldn't exist. You understand that the laws of physics are merely suggestions, and with the right formula, you can rewrite them. But be warned: the energy you channel is older than the cities you defend, and it does not like to be tamed.

* **Unique Attribute:** **ARCANA (d8)**
    * *Used for:* Casting Principles, Identifying Magic, and Initiative.
* **Resource:** **Resonance**
    * *Generation:* You accrue this as you cast. Magic costs your own life force.
* **Magic Principle:** Magic is measured in Magnitude (1, 2, or 3).

### INTRINSIC PERKS (Gain All 3)
1.  **The Sight:** You perceive the unseen. You automatically detect active magic, curses, and deep Murk phenomena without rolling. You know exactly what killed the ghost before you see the body.
2.  **Mental Fortress:** Your mind is categorized and reinforced. When making a **Mind Save** against Mental Stress (Fear, Horror, Casting Cost), you roll **4 Mind Dice** (instead of 3).
    * *The Edge:* You can withstand the psychological toll of the Murk (and the strain of your own spells) far better than others.
3.  **The Conduit:**
    * **Cast:** To cast a Principle, you channel energy through your nervous system. Roll **1d4 Stress per Magnitude** of the spell and add it directly to your Stress Track. (This triggers an immediate Mind Save).
    * **Vent:** You may spend an Action to "Vent" accumulated Resonance. Remove **d6 Stress** from your track. However, this releases a shockwave; if you Vent in combat, you deal **2 Damage** to everyone within Near Range (Ally or Enemy).

## 3. THE ACOLYTE
**The Chaplain. The Medic. The Anchor.**

The gods may be silent, but that is no excuse to abandon the faithful. You are the steel in the spine of your group. Whether you serve the rigid laws of Makru, the mourning rites of the Penitent Choir, or the elemental truths of the Nine Mothers, you provide the one thing the Murk cannot destroy: purpose. You are more than a healer; you are a witness to the suffering of the world, refusing to let your companions succumb to the despair that waits in the dark.

* **Unique Attribute:** **DEVOTION (d8)**
    * *Used for:* Resisting Corruption, Parley, and Divine Initiative.
* **Resource:** **Favor**
    * *Generation:* You start each Episode with Favor equal to your Rank. You gain +1 Favor whenever you perform a significant Act of Faith (converting an NPC, burying the dead, destroying a heresy). Max 6.

### INTRINSIC PERKS (Gain All 3)
1.  **Iron Soul:** Your spirit is weighted by conviction. When making a **Spirit Save** against Spiritual Stress (Corruption, Possession, Despair), you roll **4 Spirit Dice** (instead of 3).
2.  **Sanctified:** The darkness finds you painful to touch. You add **+1 Die** to your Total on any Contested Roll against Spirits, Undead, or Murkborn entities (e.g., grappling a ghoul or holding a door against a ghost).
3.  **The Tithe:** You are a servant of the divine. You are fed, housed, and healed for free by any faithful institution or community aligned with your deity.

## 4. THE RUFFIAN
**The Scavenger. The Agent. The Shadow.**

Honor is a luxury for the rich; you prefer survival. You are the product of the streets, the Rungs, and the criminal underworld. You might be a thief for the Guilds, a spy for a foreign power, or simply someone who knows how to open a locked door when the air is running out. You fight dirty because there is no prize for dying fair. While the Soldier holds the line, you are the one finding the exit, securing the loot, and ensuring there is a tomorrow to worry about.

* **Unique Attribute:** **GUILE (d8)**
    * *Used for:* Stealth, Deception, Thievery, and Initiative.
* **Resource:** **Trick Tokens**
    * *Generation:* At the start of a Scene, "Wager" up to 3 Tokens. Roll a Guile Check (DR 12). Success doubles the wager; Failure loses them. (Min 1 guaranteed).

### INTRINSIC PERKS (Gain All 3)
1.  **Streetwise:** You speak the language of the desperate. You can make a Guile Check to instantly locate a Black Market, Fence, or Safehouse in any settlement.
    * *Success:* You find it immediately.
    * *Failure:* You find it, but the locals know you are coming, or the price is doubled.
2.  **Slippery:** You refuse to go down. If you fail a Stress Save and take a Rank of Suffering, you may spend **1 Token** to force an immediate **Re-Roll** of the Save. You must take the second result. (A second chance to stay clean).
3.  **Scavenger's Eye (Deep Pockets):** Once per Scene, you may spend **1 Token** to produce a common Utility Item (Lockpick, Rope, Alcohol, Crowbar) from your pockets, claiming you "lifted it earlier."

# CHAPTER 3: THE DIVERGENT (SPECIES)

In the years since the Calamity, humanity has branched. Some have remained pure, clinging to the old ways. Others have been changed by the fog, the factories, or the forbidden blood of the wild.

---

## 1. HUMAN
**The Desperate Majority.**

Humans are the baseline of Tellus. They are the refugees of Ruthenia, the factory workers of Carantha, and the nomads of the Steppe. They lack the thick hide of the Chimera or the iron skin of the Anthroparion, but they possess a terrifying adaptability. They are the only species that refuses to accept that the world has ended.

* **THE SPARK (Ambition):** Humans push themselves harder than any other kin. You gain **+1 to your Maximum Resource Cap** (Command Points, Resonance, Favor, or Tokens).

---

## 2. MURKBORN
**The Children of the Fog.**

Born in the settlements deep within the Murk, these individuals have been changed by the toxic air. They are pale, often hairless, with eyes that reflect light like a cat’s. To a Murkborn, the fog is not an enemy; it is a neighbor. They are uncomfortable in the bright sun and clean air of the upper peaks.

* **FOG-LUNG (Immunity):** You are immune to the environmental Toxicity of the Murk. You do not make Body Saves for breathing the fog, and you do not suffer Lung Rot. (Note: You are still susceptible to the psychological effects of the fog).
* **STIGMA (The Outsider):** Civilized society fears you. You increase the Difficulty of all **Social Checks** with "Civilized" NPCs (Nobles, Merchants, Guards) by **+2**. They assume you are a spy for the monsters.

---

## 3. ANTHROPARION
**The Souls in Iron.**

The Anthroparion are not robots; they are people. Whether through ancient Vardan soul-binding rituals or radical experimental surgeries in Carantha, these are human souls anchored to chassis of ceramic, iron, and wood. They do not breathe, they do not bleed, but they still feel fear. They are heavy, clanking, and tireless.

* **PLATING (Iron Skin):** Your body is a fortress. You have natural **Armor 1**. (Reduce all Physical Stress taken by 1, to a minimum of 0).
* **INORGANIC (Scarcity):** Standard medicine fails you. Med-Kits and Potions have no effect on you. To remove Stress or Suffering, you require a **Repair Kit** and someone with technical skill. (This makes you dependent on resources that are harder to find than bandages).

---

## 4. CHIMERA
**The Wildtouched.**

Chimeras are the result of the "Old Blood"—ancient pacts made with the spirits of the deep woods or the result of magical fallout from the War. They appear mostly human, but with distinct bestial traits: patches of fur, goat-like eyes, claws, or antlers. They are creatures of instinct, deeply connected to the natural flow of magic, which makes them powerful but unstable.

* **BEAST BLOOD (Adaptation):** Choose one biological mutation:
    * **Predator:** Your Unarmed attacks deal **d6 damage** (Claws/Fangs).
    * **Night-Eyes:** You can see perfectly in dim light and starlight.
    * **Thick Hide:** You ignore the effects of extreme Cold or Heat.
* **BEACON (Magical Resonance):** Your blood sings to the ether. Spirits, Ghosts, and Murk-Entities always prioritize you. If a supernatural enemy has a choice between attacking you or a Human, it will always choose you. You cannot hide from magical detection.
