# CHAPTER 2: THE ARCHETYPES

In *The Murk*, your profession is not merely a job; it is a survival strategy. While the common folk cower in the Rungs, you have honed the specific talents required to walk into the fog and return with your mind and body intact.

### 0. THE BASELINE (SURVIVING STRESS)
*Before choosing Archetypes, understand how damage works.*
In this game, there is one **Stress Track**. Every source of damage—bullets, fear, magic—adds to this single number.

* **The Save:** Immediately after taking damage, you must roll to see if you can handle the new **Total Stress**.
* **The Dice Pool:** By default, you roll **3 Attribute Dice** corresponding to the source of the damage (Body, Mind, or Spirit).
* **Success:** Your Total Roll > Current Stress. You are fine.
* **Failure:** Your Total Roll ≤ Current Stress. You take a **Rank of Suffering** (and Stress resets to 0).
