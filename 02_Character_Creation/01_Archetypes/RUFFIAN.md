## 4. THE RUFFIAN
**The Scavenger. The Agent. The Shadow.**

Honor is a luxury for the rich; you prefer survival. You are the product of the streets, the Rungs, and the criminal underworld. You might be a thief for the Guilds, a spy for a foreign power, or simply someone who knows how to open a locked door when the air is running out. You fight dirty because there is no prize for dying fair. While the Soldier holds the line, you are the one finding the exit, securing the loot, and ensuring there is a tomorrow to worry about.

* **Unique Attribute:** **GUILE (d8)**
    * *Used for:* Stealth, Deception, Thievery, and Initiative.
* **Resource:** **Trick Tokens**
    * *Generation:* At the start of a Scene, "Wager" up to 3 Tokens. Roll a Guile Check (DR 12). Success doubles the wager; Failure loses them. (Min 1 guaranteed).

### INTRINSIC PERKS (Gain All 3)
1.  **Streetwise:** You speak the language of the desperate. You can make a Guile Check to instantly locate a Black Market, Fence, or Safehouse in any settlement.
    * *Success:* You find it immediately.
    * *Failure:* You find it, but the locals know you are coming, or the price is doubled.
2.  **Slippery:** You refuse to go down. If you fail a Stress Save and take a Rank of Suffering, you may spend **1 Token** to force an immediate **Re-Roll** of the Save. You must take the second result. (A second chance to stay clean).
3.  **Scavenger's Eye (Deep Pockets):** Once per Scene, you may spend **1 Token** to produce a common Utility Item (Lockpick, Rope, Alcohol, Crowbar) from your pockets, claiming you "lifted it earlier."
