# THE RUFFIAN
**The Scavenger. The Agent. The Shadow.**

Honor is a luxury for the rich; you prefer survival. You are the product of the streets, the lower Rungs, and the criminal underworld. You might be a thief for the Guilds, a spy for a foreign power, or simply someone who knows how to open a locked door when the air is running out. You fight dirty because there is no prize for dying fair. While the Soldier holds the line, you are the one finding the exit, securing the loot, and ensuring there is a tomorrow to worry about.

* **Attribute Focus:** **GUILE (d8)** & **AGILITY (d6)**
* **Resource:** **Trick Tokens** (Luck & dirty tricks).
* **Starting Health:** 10 + Body.
* **Starting Stress:** 0 (Max 10).

---

## THE RESOURCE: TRICK TOKENS
You run on luck, but luck runs out. You must manage your fortune carefully.

### 1. THE ANTE (Episode Start)
At the start of every Episode (Game Session), roll your **GUILE DIE**.
* **The Result:** This is your starting pool of Trick Tokens.
* **The Cap:** You can never hold more Tokens than the maximum value of your Guile Die (e.g., 8). Tokens persist between Scenes but expire at the end of the Episode.

### 2. THE GAMBLE (Scene Start)
At the start of a Scene, you may choose to push your luck (Optional). Flip a coin.
* **Heads:** You are on a hot streak. Gain **+2 Tokens**.
* **Tails:** You pushed too hard. Lose **1 Token**.

### 3. THE BAD BEAT (Regeneration)
You adapt best when things go wrong.
* **Trigger:** When you roll a **BOTCH** on a Skill Check or Save.
    * *Definition of a Botch:* You fail the check, **AND** your Attribute Die shows a natural "1".
* **Effect:** You instantly gain **+1 Token**. You scramble, improvise, and find an unfair advantage in the chaos.

---

## INTRINSIC PERKS (You start with all 3)

### 1. STREETWISE
You speak the language of the desperate. You can make a **Guile Check** to instantly locate a Black Market, Fence, or Safehouse in any settlement.
* **Success:** You find it immediately. The proprietor knows you (or your type) and offers fair rates.
* **Failure:** You find it, but it’s a trap, a sting operation, or the locals demand a "Protection Fee" to let you enter.

### 2. SLIPPERY
You refuse to go down.
* **Effect:** If you fail a **Body** or **Agility Save** and are about to take Physical Damage or Stress, you may spend **1 Token** to force an immediate **Re-Roll**. You must take the second result.

### 3. DEEP POCKETS
You always have the right tool for the crime.
* **Effect:** Once per Scene, you may spend **1 Token** to produce a common **Utility Item** (Lockpick, Rope, Alcohol, Crowbar, Matchbook) from your pockets, claiming you "lifted it earlier." The item is removed from your inventory at the end of the session.

## THE TALENT TREE
*Spend Potential (XP) to unlock these abilities. These focus on dirty fighting, mobility, and cheating fate.*

### TIER 1: THE GUTTER RAT (3 Potential Each)
* **POCKET SAND (1 Token):**
    **Action:** You throw dust, ash, or grit into an enemy's eyes (Close Range).
    **Effect:** Target is **Blinded** (Blind Fire only, Disadvantage on Defense) until they spend an Action to clear their eyes.
* **GUTTER RUNNER (Passive):**
    You move like water through trash.
    **Effect:** You climb at full speed. You suffer no movement penalties for squeezing through tight spaces, moving through crowds, or traversing difficult terrain (rubble/mud).
* **STICKY FINGERS (Passive):**
    You loot while you fight.
    **Effect:** When you loot a body or container, you find **+1 Random Item** and **+1 Trick Token** (up to your Cap).

### TIER 2: THE SCOUNDREL (6 Potential Each)
* **THE SHIV (2 Tokens):**
    **Action:** You attack a target that has not acted yet this turn, or is unaware of you.
    **Effect:** Deal **Weapon Damage + 2d6**. If you roll a "6" on any of the damage dice, they explode (roll again and add).
* **SUCKER PUNCH (1 Token):**
    **Reaction:** You can make a Melee Attack *before* Initiative is rolled at the start of combat.
    **Effect:** If this attack hits, the target is **Stunned** (misses their first turn).
* **SILVER TONGUE (Passive):**
    You can lie to anyone, even yourself.
    **Effect:** You have **Advantage** on Guile checks to lie, disguise yourself, or forge documents. If you fail a social check, you can spend **1 Token** to change the outcome to a "Success at a Cost."

### TIER 3: THE MASTERMIND (9 Potential Each)
* **THE MASTER PLAN (Flashback):**
    **Action:** You reveal that you prepared for this exact situation hours ago.
    **Effect:** Spend **3 Tokens**. You may narrate a "Flashback" where you set a trap, bribed a guard, unlocked this specific door, or planted an item. The Director determines the limits, but it effectively solves the current puzzle instantly.
* **GHOST IN THE FOG (Stealth):**
    **Passive:** You can Hide even while being observed, provided there is *any* cover (fog, shadow, furniture) nearby.
    **Effect:** If you attack from Hiding, you recover **1 Token**.
* **CHEAT DEATH:**
    **Reaction:** When you fail a **Save** against accumulated Stress (The Break) and are about to take a Rank of Suffering.
    **Cost:** Spend **All Remaining Tokens** (Minimum 1).
    **Effect:** You treat the failed roll as a **Critical Success**. You take **0 Ranks of Suffering** and avoid the Break entirely.
    * *The Narrative:* The blade caught your belt buckle; the collapse pinned your coat but not your leg; you woke up just before the gas took you.
