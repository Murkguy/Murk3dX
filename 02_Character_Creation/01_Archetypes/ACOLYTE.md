## 3. THE ACOLYTE
**The Chaplain. The Medic. The Anchor.**

The gods may be silent, but that is no excuse to abandon the faithful. You are the steel in the spine of your group. Whether you serve the rigid laws of Makru, the mourning rites of the Penitent Choir, or the elemental truths of the Nine Mothers, you provide the one thing the Murk cannot destroy: purpose. You are more than a healer; you are a witness to the suffering of the world, refusing to let your companions succumb to the despair that waits in the dark.

* **Unique Attribute:** **DEVOTION (d8)**
    * *Used for:* Resisting Corruption, Parley, and Divine Initiative.
* **Resource:** **Favor**
    * *Generation:* You start each Episode with Favor equal to your Rank. You gain +1 Favor whenever you perform a significant Act of Faith (converting an NPC, burying the dead, destroying a heresy). Max 6.

### INTRINSIC PERKS (Gain All 3)
1.  **Iron Soul:** Your spirit is weighted by conviction. When making a **Spirit Save** against Spiritual Stress (Corruption, Possession, Despair), you roll **4 Spirit Dice** (instead of 3).
2.  **Sanctified:** The darkness finds you painful to touch. You add **+1 Die** to your Total on any Contested Roll against Spirits, Undead, or Murkborn entities (e.g., grappling a ghoul or holding a door against a ghost).
3.  **The Tithe:** You are a servant of the divine. You are fed, housed, and healed for free by any faithful institution or community aligned with your deity.
