# THE ACOLYTE
**The Shepherd. The Zealot. The Anchor.**

You are not a magister. You cannot throw lightning. But while others see a chaotic, godless world, you see a design. You are the rock upon which your team stands. Whether you are a sanctioned priest of the Choir or a heretic whispering to old gods, your presence brings clarity to the madness of the Murk.

* **Attribute Focus:** **SPIRIT (d8)** & **MIND (d6)**
* **Resource:** **Favor** (Rolled at start of session).
* **Unique Attribute:** **Devotion Die (d6)**.

## INTRINSIC PERKS (You start with all 3)

### 1. THE COVENANT
You possess **The Spark**. You are the only Archetype capable of generating Favor and using the **Petition System**. Without you, the Gods are silent.

### 2. SHEPHERD OF THE LOST
To the common folk of the Shelf, you are holy.
* **Sanctuary:** You can expect free lodging and food in any settlement that follows your faith.
* **The Cloth:** Baselines are reluctant to attack you. You have **Advantage** on social checks to de-escalate violence before it starts. (Does not work on monsters or fanatics).

### 3. CONFESSOR (Passive Perception)
People feel a supernatural compulsion to unburden themselves to you.
* **The Effect:** If you spend a Scene talking to an NPC, the Director must reveal one **Secret**, **Fear**, or **Regret** that NPC is hiding. They might not say it outright, but they will hint at it heavily.
