## 2. THE ESOTERIST
**The Researcher. The Occultist. The Volatile.**

Magic is not a miracle; it is a science that humanity has simply forgotten how to control. While the world cowers from the supernatural, you dissect it. You are a student of "Esoteria"—the dangerous intersection of ancient Vardan rituals and modern industrial theory. You might be a disgraced academic from the Palatine colleges or a field researcher clutching a book of geometries that shouldn't exist. You understand that the laws of physics are merely suggestions, and with the right formula, you can rewrite them. But be warned: the energy you channel is older than the cities you defend, and it does not like to be tamed.

* **Attribute Focus:** **ARCANA (d8)** & **MIND (d6)**
* **Resource:** **Agony** (Generated by casting; managed by venting).
* **Starting Health:** 10 + Body
* **Starting Stress:** 0 (Max 10)
* **Starting Rank:** **Neophyte** (Initiated, but untested).

## INTRINSIC PERKS (You start with all 3)

### 1. THE SIGHT
You perceive the unseen. You automatically detect active magic, curses, and deep Murk phenomena without rolling. You know exactly what killed the ghost before you see the body.

### 2. MENTAL FORTRESS
Your mind is categorized and reinforced. When making a **Mind Save** against Mental Stress (Fear, Horror, or **Agony**), you roll **4 Mind Dice** (instead of the standard 3). You can withstand the psychological toll of the Murk better than anyone.

### 3. THE CONDUIT (CAST & VENT)
* **Cast:** To cast a spell, you channel energy through your nervous system. Roll **1d4 Stress per Magnitude** of the spell. This accumulation of pain is called **Agony**.
* **Vent:** You may spend an Action to "Vent" accumulated Agony. Remove **d6 Stress** from your track.
    * **Warning:** This releases a psychic shockwave. If you Vent in combat, you deal **2 Damage** to everyone within Near Range (Ally or Enemy).

## THE SPELLBOOK (THE PRINCIPLES)
*All Esoterists know the formulas for these three Principles. You do not need to unlock them; you simply choose which to cast.*

### PRINCIPLE OF KINETICS (Force & Weight)
* **Mag 1:** **Impact.** 2d6 Damage + Push target back.
* **Mag 2:** **Crush.** Destroy an object, break a lock, or sunder Armor (reduce Rating to 0).
* **Mag 3:** **Gravity Well.** 4d6 Damage to an entire Zone. Crush everyone to the floor.

### PRINCIPLE OF ENTROPY (Decay & Time)
* **Mag 1:** **Rust.** Instantly jam a gun, age a lock to dust, or rot food.
* **Mag 2:** **Wither.** 3d4 Damage + Target is **Weakened** (Disadvantage on Physical Checks).
* **Mag 3:** **Decay.** 3d8 Damage. If this kills the target, they turn to ash instantly.

### PRINCIPLE OF LUMINESCENCE (Light & Energy)
* **Mag 1:** **Flash.** 1d6 Damage + Target is **Blinded** (Blind fire only).
* **Mag 2:** **Laser.** 3d6 Damage. This attack ignores all Armor.
* **Mag 3:** **Arc Lightning.** 3d6 Damage. Chains to 3 separate targets.

## Talents

## THE TALENT TREE
*Spend Potential (XP) to unlock these abilities. These allow you to manipulate reality beyond simple combat spells.*

### TIER 1: THE BASICS (3 Potential Each)
* **RITUALIST (Passive):**
    You know the "Safe" formulas. You can cast **Utility Rituals** (Silence, Message, Cleanse, Mend) for **0 Stress**, provided you take 1 minute to trace the geometries. If you rush it, it costs normal Agony.
* **ARTIFICER (Passive):**
    You can permanently invest 3 Potential to bind a spell into an item (e.g., Kinetic Bullets, Entropic Grenades). The user takes the Agony when they activate it, not you.  On a botch, the spell is exhausted.
* **SOUL SIGHT (Passive):**
    You can read the aura of living things. By focusing on a target (Action), you can read their **Emotional State** (Hostile, Afraid, Deceptive). This costs **0 Stress**, but if you try to probe deeper for specific thoughts, you must pay **1d4 Stress**.

### TIER 2: REALITY MANIPULATION (6 Potential Each)
* **MATTER TRANSMUTATION:**
    You can alter the physical properties of an inanimate object (Mag 2 Agony).
    * *Examples:* Turn a stone wall into mud, turn a pool of water into gasoline, or turn the air in a room into heavy smoke. Lasts for 1 Scene.
* **THE PUPPETEER:**
    You can bend the will of a sentient being (Mag 2 Agony). The target makes a Spirit Save vs your Arcana.
    * *Success:* You control their body for 1 Action.
    * *Passive Bonus:* You have rerolls on Intimidation checks; people instinctively feel your psychic weight.
* **WEIGHT OF THE WORLD:**
    You manipulate the gravity of a specific object or person (Mag 1 Agony).
    * *Effect:* Make a heavy safe light enough to carry, or make an enemy's sword too heavy to lift.

### TIER 3: THE HIGH RITES (9 Potential Each)
* **REMOTE VIEWING (Scrying):**
    **The Ritual:** Requires a reflective surface and 10 minutes.
    **The Effect:** You can see and hear any location you have visited before, or any person you have a biological sample of.
    **The Cost:** You take **1 Stress** per minute of viewing. If you are detected (Spirit contest), you take **d6 Psychic Damage**.
* **SYMPATHETIC MAGIC (Assassination):**
    **The Ritual:** Requires a biological link to the target (hair, blood) and an effigy.
    **The Effect:** You cast a Principle (Kinetics/Entropy) on the effigy. The target suffers the effect regardless of distance.
    **The Cost:** **Double Agony.** (e.g., Mag 2 spell costs 2d4 x 2 Stress). If you fail the Mind Save, the damage reflects back onto *you* instead.
* **THE GRAND RITE (Storytelling):**
    **The Ritual:** This allows you to attempt *anything* (Changing weather, curing a plague, collapsing a building).
    **The Mechanic:**
    1.  Describe the impossible feat.
    2.  The Director assigns a **Success Threshold** (e.g., 5 Successes).
    3.  You roll Arcana checks. Each success adds to the total. Each failure adds **d6 Stress** to you and advances a "Disaster Track."
    4.  If you hit the Threshold, reality breaks in your favor. If you Stress Out first, the energy detonates catastrophically.
* **DAEMONOLOGIST (Summoning):**
    **The Ritual:** You learn the **Rite of Volition**. You can summon Minor, Major, and Prime Daemons.
    **The Benefit:** You treat all Daemons as having **+1 Favor** when summoned (Total 4).
    **The Passive:** You can identify Rogue Daemons on sight and have Advantage on checks to Banish or Bind them.
