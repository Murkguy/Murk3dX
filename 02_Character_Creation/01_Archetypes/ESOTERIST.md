## 2. THE ESOTERIST
**The Researcher. The Occultist. The Volatile.**

Magic is not a miracle; it is a science that humanity has simply forgotten how to control. While the world cowers from the supernatural, you dissect it. You are a student of "Esoteria"—the dangerous intersection of ancient Vardan rituals and modern industrial theory. You might be a disgraced academic from the Palatine colleges or a field researcher clutching a book of geometries that shouldn't exist. You understand that the laws of physics are merely suggestions, and with the right formula, you can rewrite them. But be warned: the energy you channel is older than the cities you defend, and it does not like to be tamed.

* **Unique Attribute:** **ARCANA (d8)**
    * *Used for:* Casting Principles, Identifying Magic, and Initiative.
* **Resource:** **Resonance**
    * *Generation:* You accrue this as you cast. Magic costs your own life force.
* **Magic Principle:** Magic is measured in Magnitude (1, 2, or 3).

### INTRINSIC PERKS (Gain All 3)
1.  **The Sight:** You perceive the unseen. You automatically detect active magic, curses, and deep Murk phenomena without rolling. You know exactly what killed the ghost before you see the body.
2.  **Mental Fortress:** Your mind is categorized and reinforced. When making a **Mind Save** against Mental Stress (Fear, Horror, Casting Cost), you roll **4 Mind Dice** (instead of 3).
    * *The Edge:* You can withstand the psychological toll of the Murk (and the strain of your own spells) far better than others.
3.  **The Conduit:**
    * **Cast:** To cast a Principle, you channel energy through your nervous system. Roll **1d4 Stress per Magnitude** of the spell and add it directly to your Stress Track. (This triggers an immediate Mind Save).
    * **Vent:** You may spend an Action to "Vent" accumulated Resonance. Remove **d6 Stress** from your track. However, this releases a shockwave; if you Vent in combat, you deal **2 Damage** to everyone within Near Range (Ally or Enemy).
