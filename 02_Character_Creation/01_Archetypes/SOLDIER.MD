## 1. THE SOLDIER
**The Specialist. The Veteran. The Wall.**

The Great War technically ended years ago, but for you, the ceasefire was just a suggestion. You are a creature of discipline in a world of chaos. Whether you are a disillusioned veteran of the Vardan trench-lines, a mercenary protecting trade caravans from Murk-beasts, or an enforcer for a Merchant House, you solve problems with ballistics. While others panic at the sight of a horror, you check your magazine and calculate the firing angle. You are the line in the sand.

* **Unique Attribute:** **TACTICS (d8)**
    * *Used for:* Initiative, Threat Assessment, and tactical command.
* **Resource:** **Command Points (CP)**
    * *Generation:* At the start of Combat, roll your Tactics Die. The result is your CP Pool for that scene.

### INTRINSIC PERKS (Gain All 3)
1.  **Standard Issue:** You are trained to fight under load. You ignore the **Clumsy Tag** on Heavy Armor and Heavy Weapons. (Normally, these items apply a -2 Penalty to Movement and Stealth).
2.  **Grit:** You are a slab of iron. When making a **Body Save** against Physical Stress, you roll **4 Body Dice** (instead of 3).
    * *The Edge:* Where a civilian rolls 3d10 to beat a Stress of 15, you roll 4d10. You are significantly more likely to shrug off heavy damage without Breaking.
3.  **The Bandolier:** You are never unarmed. Once per Scene, you may spend **1 CP** to reveal that you packed a specific Combat Consumable (Grenade, Flare, Breach Charge, or Ammo Clip), even if it wasn't on your inventory sheet.
