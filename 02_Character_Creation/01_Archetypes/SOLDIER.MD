# THE SOLDIER
**The Specialist. The Veteran. The Wall.**

The Great War technically ended years ago, but for you, the ceasefire was just a suggestion. You are a creature of discipline in a world of chaos. Whether you are a disillusioned veteran of the Vardan trench-lines, a mercenary protecting trade caravans from Murk-beasts, or an enforcer for a Merchant House, you solve problems with ballistics. While others panic at the sight of a horror, you check your magazine and calculate the firing angle. You are the line in the sand.

* **Attribute Focus:** **TACTICS (d8)** & **BODY (d6)**
* **Resource:** **Command Points (CP)**.


---

## THE RESOURCE: COMMAND POINTS (CP)
You do not fight on instinct; you fight with a plan.
* **Generation:** At the start of any **Combat** or **Hazard Scene**, roll your **TACTICS DIE**. The result is your **CP Pool** for that scene.
* **Conservation:** CP expires at the end of the Scene. You cannot hoard it.

---

## INTRINSIC PERKS (You start with all 3)

### 1. STANDARD ISSUE
You are trained to fight under load. You ignore the **Clumsy Tag** on Heavy Armor and Heavy Weapons.
* *The Benefit:* While others suffer -2 to Movement and Stealth in Plate or with Machine Guns, you move normally.

### 2. GRIT
You are a slab of iron. When making a **Body Save** against Physical Stress (Pain, Poison, Exhaustion), you roll **4 Body Dice** (instead of the standard 3).
* *The Edge:* You are significantly more likely to shrug off heavy damage without Breaking.

### 3. THE BANDOLIER
You are never unarmed.
* *The Effect:* Once per Scene, you may spend **1 CP** to reveal that you packed a specific **Combat Consumable** (Grenade, Flare, Breach Charge, or Ammo Clip), even if it wasn't on your inventory sheet. You retroactively prepared for this exact moment.
