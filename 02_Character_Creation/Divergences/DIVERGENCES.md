# CHAPTER 3: THE DIVERGENT (SPECIES)

In the years since the Calamity, humanity has branched. Some have remained pure, clinging to the old ways. Others have been changed by the fog, the factories, or the forbidden blood of the wild.

---

## 1. HUMAN
**The Desperate Majority.**

Humans are the baseline of Tellus. They are the refugees of Ruthenia, the factory workers of Carantha, and the nomads of the Steppe. They lack the thick hide of the Chimera or the iron skin of the Anthroparion, but they possess a terrifying adaptability. They are the only species that refuses to accept that the world has ended.

* **THE SPARK (Ambition):** Humans push themselves harder than any other kin. You gain **+1 to your Maximum Resource Cap** (Command Points, Resonance, Favor, or Tokens).

## 2. MURKBORN
**The Children of the Fog.**

Born in the settlements deep within the Murk, these individuals have been changed by the toxic air. They are pale, often hairless, with eyes that reflect light like a cat’s. To a Murkborn, the fog is not an enemy; it is a neighbor. They are uncomfortable in the bright sun and clean air of the upper peaks.

* **FOG-LUNG (Immunity):** You are immune to the environmental Toxicity of the Murk. You do not make Body Saves for breathing the fog, and you do not suffer Lung Rot. (Note: You are still susceptible to the psychological effects of the fog).
* **STIGMA (The Outsider):** Civilized society fears you. You increase the Difficulty of all **Social Checks** with "Civilized" NPCs (Nobles, Merchants, Guards) by **+2**. They assume you are a spy for the monsters.

## 3. ANTHROPARION
**The Souls in Iron.**

The Anthroparion are not robots; they are people. Whether through ancient Vardan soul-binding rituals or radical experimental surgeries in Carantha, these are human souls anchored to chassis of ceramic, iron, and wood. They do not breathe, they do not bleed, but they still feel fear. They are heavy, clanking, and tireless.

* **PLATING (Iron Skin):** Your body is a fortress. You have natural **Armor 1**. (Reduce all Physical Stress taken by 1, to a minimum of 0).
* **INORGANIC (Scarcity):** Standard medicine fails you. Med-Kits and Potions have no effect on you. To remove Stress or Suffering, you require a **Repair Kit** and someone with technical skill. (This makes you dependent on resources that are harder to find than bandages).

## 4. CHIMERA
**The Wildtouched.**

Chimeras are the result of the "Old Blood"—ancient pacts made with the spirits of the deep woods or the result of magical fallout from the War. They appear mostly human, but with distinct bestial traits: patches of fur, goat-like eyes, claws, or antlers. They are creatures of instinct, deeply connected to the natural flow of magic, which makes them powerful but unstable.

* **BEAST BLOOD (Adaptation):** Choose one biological mutation:
    * **Predator:** Your Unarmed attacks deal **d6 damage** (Claws/Fangs).
    * **Night-Eyes:** You can see perfectly in dim light and starlight.
    * **Thick Hide:** You ignore the effects of extreme Cold or Heat.
* **BEACON (Magical Resonance):** Your blood sings to the ether. Spirits, Ghosts, and Murk-Entities always prioritize you. If a supernatural enemy has a choice between attacking you or a Human, it will always choose you. You cannot hide from magical detection.
