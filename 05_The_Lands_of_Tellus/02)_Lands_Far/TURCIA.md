## 1. TURCIA (THE LAND OF LIVING GODS)
**Status:** Active / Theocratic Empire.

A land steeped in history, Turcia has evolved from a realm of nomadic steppe warriors into an empire with a complex social structure. In the past five centuries, it has embraced a rigid Theocracy.

### THE IMMORTAL KING
The enigmatic presence of the **Golden Lord** first emerges in records around 470 BBD. Unlike mortal rulers, he has no spouse, no heirs, and no dynasty. He simply *is*. Revered as the living embodiment of the deity Makru, he ushered in a golden age for Turcia.

### THE SILENT THRONE
However, for the past six decades, the Golden Lord has vanished from the public eye.
* **The Rumor:** The court whispers that he is dead or absent. Yet, the bureaucracy continues to function with terrifying efficiency. The armies still march; the laws are still enforced. Who is actually pulling the strings?

### THE TURCIAN WAY
To play a Turcian is to be devout, curious, and bound by complex social contracts.

**1. THE CHILDREN OF MAKRU (The Purple-Eyed)**
One of the most disturbing phenomena in Turcia is the birth of children with mesmerizing purple eyes.
* **The Blessing:** They are "collected" by the servants of the Golden Lord and taken to the Gilded Citadels.
* **The Result:** They return as elite enforcers, inquisitors, or administrators. They are fanatically loyal and possess hypnotic charisma.

**2. THE CHAIN AND THE COIN (Slavery)**
Slavery is legal but unique.
* **The Rights:** A slave has the right to earn money and purchase their freedom.
* **The Debt:** Slavery is not hereditary. A child born to a slave is free. However, "Familial Debt" can ensnare an entire family.

**3. THE CULT OF THE MIDNIGHT LADY**
While the masses worship the Golden Lord (The Sun), a clandestine cult worships his shadow.
* **The Hand:** They are the state's unofficial assassins and spies. They believe she is the Lord's necessary counterpart.
* **The Intrigue:** If the Golden Lord is indeed missing, is the Midnight Lady now ruling in his stead?

**4. THE OPEN DOOR**
Despite their terrifying government, the common Turci people are famously open.
* **Hospitality:** They value knowledge above gold. A traveler who can tell a good story from the "Old Empire" will be fed and housed.

## Synopsis

Turcicus, a land steeped in history, has seen various forms of governance throughout its existence. From being ruled by nomadic steppe warriors to an empire with a complex social structure, it has evolved over time. In the past five centuries, Turcicus has embraced a theocratic system, with a singular figure known as the Golden Lord holding dominion over the land.

The enigmatic presence of the Golden Lord first emerges in written records around the early 470s BBD. Unlike rulers with spouses or successors, the Golden Lord has defied mortality, remaining a solitary figure with no apparent heirs. Revered as a descendant or embodiment of the divine entity Makru, the Golden Lord has ushered in a golden age for Turcicus, coinciding with the decline and disappearance of the Vardan Empire. The favor of the gods seems to have bestowed its blessings upon the land of the Turci.

However, unsettling rumors have started to circulate within the court, casting doubt on the fate of the Golden Lord. For over six decades, no written accounts of the Lord have been recorded, fueling speculation that he may be deceased or absent. Despite this uncertainty, Turcicus has managed to maintain internal order and even expand its borders during this time. The implications of the Lord's absence or demise remain uncertain, and Pytharis, in the neighboring Far Lands, watches with a sense of cautious optimism, grateful for the respite from potential turmoil. The fate of Turcicus hangs in the balance, awaiting the revelation of the truth and the subsequent course of events.

The Turci at a glance
One of the remarkable phenomena in Turcicus is the occurrence of children born with mesmerizing purple eyes. These rare individuals are believed to be blessed by Makru, the deity associated with the Golden Lord. Recognized as a sign of divine favor, these children are sought out by the servants of the Golden Lord, who take them under their wing for special training and tutelage.

Slavery, although legal in Turcicus, carries certain unique aspects that distinguish it from common practices elsewhere. While slaves exist within the society, they possess certain rights that allow them to purchase their own freedom. The ability to buy one's freedom is a recognized path for slaves to regain their autonomy and become free citizens. However, it is important to note that slavery is not hereditary, and the children of slaves do not inherit their parents' enslaved status. Nevertheless, familial debt can lead to the enslavement of a family, emphasizing the interconnectedness of economic and social factors in Turcicus.

In the complex tapestry of beliefs within Turcicus, there exists a cult devoted to the worship of the enigmatic Midnight Lady, regarded by its followers as the counterpart or companion of the Golden Lord. Members of this clandestine group engage in secretive practices, including assassinations and impersonations of officials to manipulate the country's affairs according to their beliefs. The influence exerted by the cult adds a layer of intrigue and unpredictability to the already intricate power dynamics within Turcicus.

Beyond its religious and political intricacies, the Turci people themselves exhibit a distinct and endearing trait of openness and curiosity about the wider world. They eagerly welcome travelers and storytellers, valuing the exchange of knowledge and experiences. The Turci people's genuine interest prompts them to offer hospitality and often compensate individuals for sharing tales and information, further fostering a culture of dialogue and storytelling within their society.
