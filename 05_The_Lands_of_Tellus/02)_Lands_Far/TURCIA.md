## 1. TURCIA (THE LAND OF LIVING GODS)
**Status:** Active / Theocratic Empire.

A land steeped in history, Turcia has evolved from a realm of nomadic steppe warriors into an empire with a complex social structure. In the past five centuries, it has embraced a rigid Theocracy.

### THE IMMORTAL KING
The enigmatic presence of the **Golden Lord** first emerges in records around 470 BBD. Unlike mortal rulers, he has no spouse, no heirs, and no dynasty. He simply *is*. Revered as the living embodiment of the deity Makru, he ushered in a golden age for Turcia.

### THE SILENT THRONE
However, for the past six decades, the Golden Lord has vanished from the public eye.
* **The Rumor:** The court whispers that he is dead or absent. Yet, the bureaucracy continues to function with terrifying efficiency. The armies still march; the laws are still enforced. Who is actually pulling the strings?

### THE TURCIAN WAY
To play a Turcian is to be devout, curious, and bound by complex social contracts.

**1. THE CHILDREN OF MAKRU (The Purple-Eyed)**
One of the most disturbing phenomena in Turcia is the birth of children with mesmerizing purple eyes.
* **The Blessing:** They are "collected" by the servants of the Golden Lord and taken to the Gilded Citadels.
* **The Result:** They return as elite enforcers, inquisitors, or administrators. They are fanatically loyal and possess hypnotic charisma.

**2. THE CHAIN AND THE COIN (Slavery)**
Slavery is legal but unique.
* **The Rights:** A slave has the right to earn money and purchase their freedom.
* **The Debt:** Slavery is not hereditary. A child born to a slave is free. However, "Familial Debt" can ensnare an entire family.

**3. THE CULT OF THE MIDNIGHT LADY**
While the masses worship the Golden Lord (The Sun), a clandestine cult worships his shadow.
* **The Hand:** They are the state's unofficial assassins and spies. They believe she is the Lord's necessary counterpart.
* **The Intrigue:** If the Golden Lord is indeed missing, is the Midnight Lady now ruling in his stead?

**4. THE OPEN DOOR**
Despite their terrifying government, the common Turci people are famously open.
* **Hospitality:** They value knowledge above gold. A traveler who can tell a good story from the "Old Empire" will be fed and housed.
