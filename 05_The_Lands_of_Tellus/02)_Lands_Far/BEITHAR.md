## 4. BEITHAR (THE ENDLESS PLAINS)
**Status:** Active / Unifying Nomadic Horde.

In the distant northeast, the **Yoruba** people traverse the open grasslands. Their history is a pendulum swinging between infighting and terrifying unity.

### THE RISE OF BATAAR
For centuries, the Old Empire managed the Yoruba through bribery. But now, a charismatic Prince named **Bataar** has risen. If he rallies the tribes, they will be an unstoppable force capable of crushing the Shelf.

### THE YORUBA WAY
To play a Yoruba is to be honest, melodious, and devastatingly mobile.

**1. MEMORY SONGS (Oral Magic)**
* **The Magic:** Through singing, the Yoruba can physically transfer memories. An Elder sings the experience into a child's mind.
* **The Result:** A young warrior might possess the tactical instincts of a general who died two centuries ago.

**2. RIDERS OF THE RAM**
* **The Mount:** **Steppe Rams**. Massive, shaggy creatures with spiraling horns. They can charge through infantry lines like battering rams.
* **The Bond:** A Ram will fight to the death to protect its rider.

**3. THE ATLATL MASTERS**
* **The Weapon:** They prefer the **Atlatl**—a hooked implement used to propel javelins at terrifying speeds.
* **The Advantage:** Silent, reusable, and capable of punching through modern armor.

**4. THE TRUTH UNBROKEN**
* **The Taboo:** Their legends recount dire punishments for those who deceive. To call a Yoruba a liar is to challenge them to violence.
