## 2. SUOMI (THE FROZEN NORTH)
**Status:** Active / Tribal Confederacy.

Deep in the northern reaches, where the rugged mountains embrace the eternal snow, reside the Suomi. While Novemgrod hides behind walls, the Suomi embrace the cold. They embody a spirit of freedom and strength, cultivating a warrior culture.

### THE ALTHING (The 36 Voices)
The Suomi are organized into Eighteen Tribes.
* **The Structure:** Each tribe is led by a pair: a **Joht** (Warlord) and a **Noaidi** (Shaman).
* **The Council:** Together, these thirty-six individuals form the **Althing**.
* **The Tie-Breakers:** The **Vuorenuja**—Elder Noaidi who have climbed the sacred peaks—hold the power to break deadlocks.

### THE SUOMARAN WAY
To play a Suomi is to be massive, honorable, and dangerously honest.

**1. THE SECOND SON (The Mercenary)**
Inheritance is strictly linked to the firstborn.
* **The Tradition:** Second-born children leave the tribe to seek their fortune.
* **The Reputation:** These "Suomaran" are celebrated mercenaries, often approaching 7 feet tall. A Suomaran bodyguard is a status symbol in the South.

**2. THE MOUNTAIN GODS (Tursakkaanen)**
The Suomi revere the spirits of the peaks of Aventhorn.
* **The Rite of Passage:** Aspiring leaders must climb Aventhorn. Those who survive often emerge changed, claiming to hear the whispers of the gods in the wind.

**3. THE SPRING GAMES**
Suomi society values physical might above all else.
* **The Event:** Annually, the tribes gather for grueling tests of lifting, throwing, and wrestling. To win a Spring Game is to earn a seat at the Joht’s table.

**4. HOSPITALITY AND BLOOD**
* **The Rule:** If you are a guest, you are family.
* **The Edge:** If that hospitality is abused, or if a guest lies, the peaceful demeanor vanishes. Suomi justice involves an axe.
