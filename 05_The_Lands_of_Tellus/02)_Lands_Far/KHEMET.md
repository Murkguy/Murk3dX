## 3. KEMET (THE BLACK RIVER)
**Status:** Active / Occupied Apartheid State.

Nestled amidst the lands of the Black River to the South-West, Kemet stands as the oldest civilization on Tellus. Its monuments predate the memories of the Vardan Empire.

### THE OCCUPATION
Centuries ago, Kemet receded into isolation. The Dorians seized this vulnerability and established a puppet government.

### THE TURNING POINT
With the fall of Doria to the Murk, the occupiers are trapped. Instead of retreating, they have tightened their grip, establishing a brutal Apartheid State to ensure their own survival.
* **The Rebellion:** A young Pharaoh named **Shafra-Ab** is rallying the native populace to expel the "Homeless Conquerors."

### THE KEMETAN SPIRIT
To play a Kemetan is to be proud, spiritual, and simmering with righteous anger.

**1. THE BLACK RIVER**
* **The Lifeblood:** The river is perceived as the blood of the earth itself.
* **The Magic:** Kemetan spirituality focuses on the divinity of the water. Rituals involving river mud are common.

**2. THE ANCIENT CURSE**
Scattered across Kemet are temples that predate even Kemetan memory.
* **The Danger:** Locals believe these sites are haunted by the spirits of a civilization the gods erased. To enter a Pre-Kemetan ruin is to invite a curse.

**3. HOSPITALITY AND HONOR**
* **The Custom:** It is ancient law to offer what one possesses to a traveler.
* **The Trap:** This hospitality has rules. A guest who refuses a gift commits a grave insult.
