## Synopsis

Nestled amidst the enigmatic lands of the Black River, Kemet stands as a testament to the ancient heritage that predates the memories of most. Monuments and structures, hallowed by time, bear witness to a glorious past that has influenced and inspired countless empires and kingdoms throughout the ages.

However, the grandeur of bygone eras has slowly waned, and Kemet has experienced a prolonged decline. Once a global powerhouse, it gradually receded into a regional dominion, ultimately becoming an isolated kingdom along the banks of the Black River. A succession of inept and mediocre rulers contributed to this downward trajectory, leading to courtly isolation and a reluctance to embrace technological advancements. These factors left Kemet vulnerable to external influences, casting a shadow over its former glory.

The opportunistic Dorians seized this moment of vulnerability, employing military campaigns and occupying Kemet to establish their control over the court and civil systems. Despite their dominance, they dared not depose the revered Pharaohs, whose sacred status and cultural influence held immense sway over the people. Thus, a delicate balance emerged, with the Dorians reigning over Kemet while cautiously avoiding a mass rebellion.

However, with the fall of Doria, a home to call upon in times of need no longer existed for the people of Kemet. In this critical juncture, a young and ambitious Pharaoh named Shafra-Ab has taken it upon himself to rally his forces and expel the Dorians from their ancestral lands. Sensing the impending threat, the Dorians have tightened their grip, strategically funneling expatriate groups from Doria into the kingdom, in a bid to perpetuate their dominance and preserve their hold on power.

Kemet, once the cradle of ancient wisdom and profound civilization, now finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with the shadows of its past and the uncertainties of its future. The fate of the kingdom hangs in the balance as the Pharaoh Shafra-Ab embarks on a daring quest to reclaim Kemet's sovereignty, while the Dorians endeavor to consolidate their control over a land that teeters on the precipice of change. The echoes of an ancient civilization resound within Kemet, and the unfolding chapters of its history will determine whether it shall rise from the ashes of decline or succumb to the tides of fate.

Kemet at a glance
Within the borders of Kemet, a land steeped in ancient mystique, a brutal apartheid state has taken root, forged by the Dorians' iron fist. The subjugated Kemet populace, who dare to challenge their oppressors, face the dire consequences of death or enslavement. The pervasive system of discrimination casts a dark shadow over the kingdom, perpetuating a cycle of fear and oppression.

Deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of the Kemet people is their reverence for the Black River, which they perceive as the lifeblood of the earth itself. The river's flowing waters hold immense spiritual significance, symbolizing the eternal connection between the land, its people, and the divine forces that govern their existence. The Black River weaves through their myths, rituals, and daily lives, serving as a source of inspiration and awe.

Scattered across the vast expanse of Kemet are ancient temples, remnants of a time preceding the rise of other kingdoms. These sacred structures, shrouded in enigma and laced with curses, stand as testaments to a forgotten era. These sites of worship, abandoned by gods and haunted by the spirits of bygone civilizations, serve as a stark reminder of the profound mysteries and deep history that permeate the land.

In spite of their own hardships and destitution, the people of Kemet embody a spirit of generosity and hospitality. Rooted in customs that span thousands of years, they offer what little they possess to those in need, embodying the enduring principles of their ancient culture. However, this noble virtue can occasionally lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, as certain habits or remarks may inadvertently offend their sensibilities, causing tensions to arise.

Within the tapestry of Kemet's existence, a complex interplay of suffering, resilience, and ancient customs unfolds. The apartheid state inflicted by the Dorians casts a shadow over the land, while the people draw strength from their reverence for the Black River and navigate the remnants of long-forgotten temples. The spirit of generosity, despite the hardships faced, remains a guiding principle, even as cultural sensitivities and ancient customs shape the interactions and dynamics within Kemet. The destiny of this ancient kingdom, with its deep-rooted traditions and turbulent history, hangs in the balance as the struggle for liberation and cultural preservation continues to unfold.
