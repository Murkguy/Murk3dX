# THE NEAR LANDS (THE OLD EMPIRE)

Beyond the immediate safety of the Mistcliffs lie the Near Lands. These are the nations that once formed the Vardan Empire. Some are destroyed, swallowed by the Murk, while others struggle to maintain sovereignty in the face of the apocalypse.

The world of Tellus is broken. To the West lies the **Murk**, an ocean of suffocating fog that swallowed the lowlands. To the East lies the **Arid Waste**, a glassed desert where nothing grows.

Humanity clings to life on the **Eastern Shelf**—a jagged uplift of rock caught between the fog and the fire. Here, on the peaks and plateaus, the last nations of men struggle for dominance.

## THE CORE (THE SHELF)
*The remnants of the Vardan Empire.*

### 1. NOVEMGROD (The Last Bastion)
The City of Altitude. The vertical metropolis clinging to the western cliffs. It is a city of refugees, scavengers, and smog.
* **Why you are here:** It is the only place safe from the Murk, yet it is where you go to dive into it. It is the center of the world.
* **The Vibe:** Victorian squalor meets high-tech desperation. Gaslamps, goggles, and grey skies.

### 2. RUTHENIA (The Old Country)
The Land of Iron & Poetry. The feudal nation surrounding Novemgrod. While the capital is industrial, the countryside is a dying landscape of mud and serfdom.
* **The People:** Stoic, artistic, and hard. They value suffering as a teacher.
* **The Vibe:** Fading grandeur, onion domes, and brutal winters.

### 3. CARANTHA (The Forge)
The Republic of Fire. A volcanic archipelago to the South. Once the Empire's soldiers, now a chaotic confederation of democratic city-states.
* **The People:** Loud, heavily armed, and aggressively hospitable. They build the guns and fly the airships.
* **The Vibe:** Industrial revolution, political gangs, and aviator leathers.

### 4. PYTHARIS (The Gilded Web)
The Merchant Peaks. A mountain republic to the South-East. They control the food and the secrets.
* **The People:** Wealthy, charming, and duplicitous. They are ruled by Merchant Princes and master spies.
* **The Vibe:** Masquerade balls, vineyards, and daggers in the dark.

### 5. DORIA (The Fallen)
The Memory. Once the heart of the Empire, now sunken beneath the Murk to the West.
* **The People:** There is no Doria, only Dorians—arrogant, noble refugees living in exile, clinging to titles of lands that no longer exist.
* **The Vibe:** Displaced aristocracy, bitterness, and obsession with ancestry.

## THE PERIPHERY (THE FAR LANDS)
*The wild powers beyond the Imperial borders.*

### 6. TURCIA (The Golden Empire)
The Theocracy. A massive empire to the South-East. Ruled by the immortal Golden Lord (who has not been seen in decades) and his Purple-Eyed enforcers.
* **The People:** Devout, curious, and bound by complex social contracts.
* **The Vibe:** Sun-worship, secret police, and unnerving perfection.

### 7. SUOMI (The Frozen North)
The Spirits of Snow. The tribal lands of the northern mountains. They resisted the Empire for centuries and now sell their swords to it.
* **The People:** Massive, honorable, and brutally honest. They commune with spirits rather than study science.
* **The Vibe:** Fur cloaks, giant axes, and silence.

### 8. KEMET (The Occupied River)
The Apartheid State. The ancient lands of the South-West, occupied by the desperate Dorian military.
* **The People:** A spiritual people divided. The native Kemetans worship the Black River and plot rebellion; the Dorian occupiers rule from walled enclaves.
* **The Vibe:** Colonial oppression, ancient ruins, and guerilla warfare.

### 9. BEITHAR (The Endless Plains)
The Horde. The nomadic horse-lords of the North-East.
* **The People:** They sing their history and ride Steppe Rams into battle. They are currently uniting under a new Warlord.
* **The Vibe:** Speed, open skies, and the thunder of hooves.
