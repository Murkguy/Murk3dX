# THE NEAR LANDS (THE OLD EMPIRE)

Beyond the immediate safety of the Mistcliffs lie the Near Lands. These are the nations that once formed the Vardan Empire. Some are destroyed, swallowed by the Murk, while others struggle to maintain sovereignty in the face of the apocalypse.

The world of Tellus is broken. To the West lies the **Murk**, an ocean of suffocating fog that swallowed the lowlands. To the East lies the **Arid Waste**, a glassed desert where nothing grows.

Humanity clings to life on the **Eastern Shelf**—a jagged uplift of rock caught between the fog and the fire. Here, on the peaks and plateaus, the last nations of men struggle for dominance.

---

## THE CORE (THE SHELF)
*The remnants of the Vardan Empire.*

### 1. NOVEMGROD (The Last Bastion)
The City of Altitude. The vertical metropolis clinging to the western cliffs. It is a city of refugees, scavengers, and smog.
* **Why you are here:** It is the only place safe from the Murk, yet it is where you go to dive into it. It is the center of the world.
* **The Vibe:** Victorian squalor meets high-tech desperation. Gaslamps, goggles, and grey skies.

### 2. RUTHENIA (The Old Country)
The Land of Iron & Poetry. The feudal nation surrounding Novemgrod. While the capital is industrial, the countryside is a dying landscape of mud and serfdom.
* **The People:** Stoic, artistic, and hard. They value suffering as a teacher.
* **The Vibe:** Fading grandeur, onion domes, and brutal winters.

### 3. CARANTHA (The Forge)
The Republic of Fire. A volcanic archipelago to the South. Once the Empire's soldiers, now a chaotic confederation of democratic city-states.
* **The People:** Loud, heavily armed, and aggressively hospitable. They build the guns and fly the airships.
* **The Vibe:** Industrial revolution, political gangs, and aviator leathers.

### 4. PYTHARIS (The Gilded Web)
The Merchant Peaks. A mountain republic to the South-East. They control the food and the secrets.
* **The People:** Wealthy, charming, and duplicitous. They are ruled by Merchant Princes and master spies.
* **The Vibe:** Masquerade balls, vineyards, and daggers in the dark.

### 5. DORIA (The Fallen)
The Memory. Once the heart of the Empire, now sunken beneath the Murk to the West.
* **The People:** There is no Doria, only Dorians—arrogant, noble refugees living in exile, clinging to titles of lands that no longer exist.
* **The Vibe:** Displaced aristocracy, bitterness, and obsession with ancestry.

---

## THE PERIPHERY (THE FAR LANDS)
*The wild powers beyond the Imperial borders.*

### 6. TURCIA (The Golden Empire)
The Theocracy. A massive empire to the South-East. Ruled by the immortal Golden Lord (who has not been seen in decades) and his Purple-Eyed enforcers.
* **The People:** Devout, curious, and bound by complex social contracts.
* **The Vibe:** Sun-worship, secret police, and unnerving perfection.

### 7. SUOMI (The Frozen North)
The Spirits of Snow. The tribal lands of the northern mountains. They resisted the Empire for centuries and now sell their swords to it.
* **The People:** Massive, honorable, and brutally honest. They commune with spirits rather than study science.
* **The Vibe:** Fur cloaks, giant axes, and silence.

### 8. KEMET (The Occupied River)
The Apartheid State. The ancient lands of the South-West, occupied by the desperate Dorian military.
* **The People:** A spiritual people divided. The native Kemetans worship the Black River and plot rebellion; the Dorian occupiers rule from walled enclaves.
* **The Vibe:** Colonial oppression, ancient ruins, and guerilla warfare.

### 9. BEITHAR (The Endless Plains)
The Horde. The nomadic horse-lords of the North-East.
* **The People:** They sing their history and ride Steppe Rams into battle. They are currently uniting under a new Warlord.
* **The Vibe:** Speed, open skies, and the thunder of hooves.

## 1. DORIA (THE LOST HEART)
**Status:** Fallen / Consumed by Murk.

Set deep within the heart of the old Vardan Empire, the lands that would later become the country of Doria hold an illustrious history. This region served as the birthplace of the original sixteen emperors, a testament to its significance as the pinnacle of power on all of Tellus. Indeed, the entirety of Doria was intricately intertwined with the legacy of the Vardan Empire, sharing not only its territories but also a capital city that remained unchanged—Varranthal.

### THE RISE AND FALL
The zenith of Doria's influence began to wane following the ascension of Emperor Regieran to the realm beyond in 1331 BBD. In the wake of his departure, the empire descended into a tumultuous era of internal strife.

Yet, amid the political turmoil, Doria experienced a resurgence under the reign of King Arminus Magnus (745 BBD). With remarkable acumen, Arminus consolidated the fragmented political landscape, ushering in a new golden era. Doria reclaimed much of its former homeland and even extended southward, subjugating the land of Kemet.

### THE BLACK DAY (0 AC)
However, the tides of fate took an irreversible turn with the advent of The Black Day. As the catastrophic event unfolded, Doria found itself at the epicenter. Its lands were consumed by the insidious Murk—a rolling sea of malevolent black fog that devoured all in its path.

The once-thriving nation became a desolate wasteland. Varranthal, the capital city that once symbolized the might of the Vardan Empire, now lies silent and lifeless beneath the fog—a ghostly reminder of the nation's former grandeur.

### THE DORIAN EXILE (CULTURE & PEOPLE)
*The Nation in Refuge.*

Only the expatriate Dorians managed to escape the grim fate, seeking refuge in nearby lands like Kemet and Novemgrod. Despite their scattered settlements, they steadfastly cling to their customs, carrying the flame of Dorian heritage wherever they go.

To play a Dorian (or interact with one) is to understand four pillars of their society:

**1. THE HOUSES OF LEGACY**
Within the remnants of the Empire, the noble houses serve as the bedrock of political influence. Many individuals take great pride in tracing their ancestry back to the Vardan Empire.
* **The Obsession:** They meticulously maintain extensive genealogical records. These ancestral connections are seen as a source of honor and legitimacy. A Dorian Noble in a refugee slum will still demand to be addressed by their full title.

**2. THE MATRIARCHY**
Dorian society is distinctly Matriarchal.
* **The Matrons:** Women hold significant influence, assuming the role of decision-makers and arrangers of marriages. Matrons play a central role in selecting suitable matches for their children, considering factors such as social standing and strategic alliances.
* **In Play:** If you want a favor from a Dorian House, you do not talk to the Duke; you talk to his Mother.

**3. HONORABLE DUELS**
The concept of personal honor is paramount. Conflicts or disputes are often resolved through ritualistic combat.
* **The Code:** These duels are not brawls; they are strictly regulated affairs used to settle grievances or restore honor. To refuse a duel is to accept social death.

**4. THE GUILD SYSTEM**
In the fabric of Doria's society, an intricate guild system thrives.
* **The Structure:** Each guild operates as a self-governing body. They include the Guild of Arcanists, Guild of Blacksmiths, Guild of Traders, and Guild of Scribes.
* **The Power:** Membership offers social recognition and access to exclusive networks. Even in exile, a Dorian Blacksmith will only teach their secrets to a fellow Guild member.

## 2. CARANTHA (THE CHAOS OF FREEDOM)
**Status:** Active / Unstable Democracy.

Situated at the farthest reaches of the Eastern Shelf, the archipelago of Carantha is a land of jagged peaks and smoking vents. Historically, it was the Empire's mailed fist—a culture of unwavering martial tradition that valued discipline above civil liberty. Their spires were not adorned with saints, but with carvings of drills, marching columns, and triumphant executions.

### THE RIVALRY
Following the collapse of the Old Empire, Carantha emerged as the primary rival to Doria. For centuries, they waged a bloody war over the borderlands of Ruthenia, turning the fields into a charnel house of steel and mud.

### THE DAY THE KINGS DIED
The Black Day saved Carantha by destroying its ambition. The fateful Battle of Doria (0 AC) saw the gathered might of the Caranthian Royal House annihilated by the initial surge of the Murk. The entire VarZolen Dynasty was wiped out, save for one nephew, Rorn, who inherited a kingdom of corpses.
Rorn's reign lasted days. He was cut down by an assassin’s blade, ending the royal line forever.

### THE NEW EXPERIMENT
Seizing the vacuum, activists and visionaries drove the nation toward a terrifying new era: Democracy. Over the past three decades, Carantha has transformed into a Confederation of City-States.
* **The Reality:** It is not a utopia. It is a mess. Political factions operate like street gangs, vying for influence. The loss of their expert military leadership has left them vulnerable, but their spirit is unbroken. They are free, and they will kill anyone who tries to take that away.

### THE CARANTHIAN SPIRIT
To play a Caranthian is to be loud, proud, and armed.

**1. BY SEA AND AIR**
Carantha is an archipelago of high-altitude peaks that rise above the Murk like islands in a black ocean.
* **The Sky-Captains:** Caranthians are the undisputed masters of the air. They pilot majestic Iron-Clad Dirigibles and gas-haulers that soar between the mountain peaks, ferrying goods and soldiers over the fog.
* **The Aesthetic:** A Caranthian doesn't walk; they swagger. They wear aviator leathers, heavy coats, and goggles as status symbols.

**2. THE GREAT FORGE**
Nestled at the base of a dormant volcano lies the industrial heart of the nation.
* **The Industry:** The intense geothermal heat allows Carantha to excel in metallurgy. While Novemgrod scavenges for Old Tech, Carantha builds new steel.
* **The Craft:** Their weapons are heavy, brutal, and reliable. A Dorian sword is a piece of art; a Caranthian hammer is a tool for murder.

**3. AGGRESSIVE HOSPITALITY**
One of the hallmarks of their culture is their legendary, almost competitive hospitality.
* **The Tradition:** It is said that no one leaves a Caranthian home without being fed to bursting. This is not just kindness; it is a display of dominance. To feed a guest is to prove you are strong enough to spare resources.
* **In Play:** A Caranthian NPC will buy the whole bar a round of drinks, then punch you in the face if you refuse to drink it.

**4. THE CITY-STATE CONFEDERATION**
Carantha is not one nation; it is a collection of rival cities (e.g., Iron-Port, High-Reach, Sulfur-Gate).
* **The Conflict:** Each city has its own laws. In one, dueling is legal; in another, it is a capital crime. Navigating Carantha requires knowing which faction owns the ground you stand on.

## 3. RUTHENIA (THE EDGE OF OBLIVION)
**Status:** Active / Feudal Industrial Nation.
**Capital City:** Novemgrod (See Chapter 1).

Ruthenia was the second land to succumb to the Old Empire’s might. Historically, it was the "Crossroads of War"—a hotly contested buffer zone between Doria and Carantha. Today, it is the last bastion of civilization on the Shelf.

### THE MERCENARY STATE
During the Great War, Ruthenia survived not by fighting, but by dealing. Recognizing their strategic value, the collective cities sold their mercenary forces to the highest bidder, draining the coffers of both Doria and Carantha.

### THE AFTERMATH
The Black Day punished Ruthenia for its hubris. The encroaching Murk took a severe toll on the eastern provinces. Many ancient political dynasties crumbled within five years.
* **The Last Capital:** With the countryside dying, the population flocked to the westernmost stronghold: Novemgrod. The city is now the beating heart of the Ruthenian nation, holding the last of its culture, its monarchy, and its industry.

### THE RUTHENIAN SOUL
To play a Ruthenian is to be stoic, cultured, and ruthlessly pragmatic.

**1. SERFS AND KINGS**
Ruthenia is the last true Feudal state on the Shelf.
* **The Korvus (The Raven King):** The ancient title for the High King of Ruthenia. Currently, Grand Prince Alexei Novikov acts as the de facto Korvus, though he has refused to take the official title until the lost territories are reclaimed.
* **The Korovladi (The Land-Owners):** The nobility. Many have lost their ancestral lands to the Murk or the Waste and now live in the "Crown" district of Novemgrod, playing political games while their serfs work the factories in the "Boiler."

**2. THE GREY MUSES (Culture)**
Despite the bleakness, Ruthenians produce the finest art on Tellus. They believe that suffering refines the soul.
* **Literature:** Ruvana Morozova (Poetry), Aleksander Petrovich (History), Natalya Dragunova (Philosophy).
* **Architecture:** The skyline of Novemgrod is the peak of Ruthenian design—impossible spires, onion domes, and flying buttresses that defy gravity.

---

## 4. PYTHARIS (THE GILDED WEB)
**Status:** Active / Merchant Republic.

Nestled across the towering peaks of the Mavren Mountains, Pytharis stands as the cultural nucleus of the Near Lands. Historically, it was the "Breadbasket of Tellus"—an agricultural powerhouse revered for art, philosophy, and exoticism.

### THE ETERNAL BATTLEFIELD
Situated between the ever-rivaling powers of Doria and Turcia, Pytharis has been a coveted economic hub and a hotly contested territory for generations. During the War, its attempts at neutrality failed; armies marched across its vineyards, planting flags only to be displaced weeks later.

### THE SURVIVOR
The Black Day spared much of Pytharis from its direct wrath. The geography of the Mavren Mountains shielded the valleys from the worst of the initial Murk-fall. This fortune granted them a significant advantage, allowing them to ward off the encroachments of Turcia and maintain a fragile independence for the past three decades.

### THE PYTHARIAN MASQUERADE
To play a Pytharian is to be charming, wealthy, and fundamentally untrustworthy.

**1. THE GOLDEN PRINCES**
Pytharis is not ruled by a King, but by a series of Merchant Princes.
* **The Game:** They vie for supremacy not through war, but through the "Art of Economics." They manipulate markets, hoard grain to starve rivals, and buy armies like others buy wine.
* **The Atmosphere:** The city-state is a labyrinthine arena of intrigue. A Golden Prince might smile at you, pay you a fortune to kill his brother, and then invite you to the funeral.

**2. THE NETWORK (Espionage)**
Pytharis boasts the finest spies in all of Tellus.
* **The Operatives:** Shrouded in secrecy, they act as the world’s brokers of information. Whispers of Pytharian spies echo in every court—from the throne room of Novemgrod to the democratic halls of Carantha.

**3. THE SILENCE OF LE VIDES**
Pytharis is home to the ancient temples of Le Vides—once vibrant centers of spiritual devotion known for their "Penitent Choirs."
* **The Silence:** On the morning of the Black Day, the Choirs stopped singing mid-verse. Since then, the temples have fallen silent. The monks have ceased their chants, the rites are abandoned, and the doors are barred. The populace believes the monks are in mourning, but the fear in their eyes suggests something far worse.

# THE FAR LANDS (BEYOND THE EMPIRE)

Beyond the borders of the Old Vardan Empire lie the Far Lands. These are nations that were never fully conquered by the Vardan legions, cultures that have evolved in isolation or opposition to the Shelf.

---

## 1. TURCIA (THE LAND OF LIVING GODS)
**Status:** Active / Theocratic Empire.

A land steeped in history, Turcia has evolved from a realm of nomadic steppe warriors into an empire with a complex social structure. In the past five centuries, it has embraced a rigid Theocracy.

### THE IMMORTAL KING
The enigmatic presence of the **Golden Lord** first emerges in records around 470 BBD. Unlike mortal rulers, he has no spouse, no heirs, and no dynasty. He simply *is*. Revered as the living embodiment of the deity Makru, he ushered in a golden age for Turcia.

### THE SILENT THRONE
However, for the past six decades, the Golden Lord has vanished from the public eye.
* **The Rumor:** The court whispers that he is dead or absent. Yet, the bureaucracy continues to function with terrifying efficiency. The armies still march; the laws are still enforced. Who is actually pulling the strings?

### THE TURCIAN WAY
To play a Turcian is to be devout, curious, and bound by complex social contracts.

**1. THE CHILDREN OF MAKRU (The Purple-Eyed)**
One of the most disturbing phenomena in Turcia is the birth of children with mesmerizing purple eyes.
* **The Blessing:** They are "collected" by the servants of the Golden Lord and taken to the Gilded Citadels.
* **The Result:** They return as elite enforcers, inquisitors, or administrators. They are fanatically loyal and possess hypnotic charisma.

**2. THE CHAIN AND THE COIN (Slavery)**
Slavery is legal but unique.
* **The Rights:** A slave has the right to earn money and purchase their freedom.
* **The Debt:** Slavery is not hereditary. A child born to a slave is free. However, "Familial Debt" can ensnare an entire family.

**3. THE CULT OF THE MIDNIGHT LADY**
While the masses worship the Golden Lord (The Sun), a clandestine cult worships his shadow.
* **The Hand:** They are the state's unofficial assassins and spies. They believe she is the Lord's necessary counterpart.
* **The Intrigue:** If the Golden Lord is indeed missing, is the Midnight Lady now ruling in his stead?

**4. THE OPEN DOOR**
Despite their terrifying government, the common Turci people are famously open.
* **Hospitality:** They value knowledge above gold. A traveler who can tell a good story from the "Old Empire" will be fed and housed.

---

## 2. SUOMI (THE FROZEN NORTH)
**Status:** Active / Tribal Confederacy.

Deep in the northern reaches, where the rugged mountains embrace the eternal snow, reside the Suomi. While Novemgrod hides behind walls, the Suomi embrace the cold. They embody a spirit of freedom and strength, cultivating a warrior culture.

### THE ALTHING (The 36 Voices)
The Suomi are organized into Eighteen Tribes.
* **The Structure:** Each tribe is led by a pair: a **Joht** (Warlord) and a **Noaidi** (Shaman).
* **The Council:** Together, these thirty-six individuals form the **Althing**.
* **The Tie-Breakers:** The **Vuorenuja**—Elder Noaidi who have climbed the sacred peaks—hold the power to break deadlocks.

### THE SUOMARAN WAY
To play a Suomi is to be massive, honorable, and dangerously honest.

**1. THE SECOND SON (The Mercenary)**
Inheritance is strictly linked to the firstborn.
* **The Tradition:** Second-born children leave the tribe to seek their fortune.
* **The Reputation:** These "Suomaran" are celebrated mercenaries, often approaching 7 feet tall. A Suomaran bodyguard is a status symbol in the South.

**2. THE MOUNTAIN GODS (Tursakkaanen)**
The Suomi revere the spirits of the peaks of Aventhorn.
* **The Rite of Passage:** Aspiring leaders must climb Aventhorn. Those who survive often emerge changed, claiming to hear the whispers of the gods in the wind.

**3. THE SPRING GAMES**
Suomi society values physical might above all else.
* **The Event:** Annually, the tribes gather for grueling tests of lifting, throwing, and wrestling. To win a Spring Game is to earn a seat at the Joht’s table.

**4. HOSPITALITY AND BLOOD**
* **The Rule:** If you are a guest, you are family.
* **The Edge:** If that hospitality is abused, or if a guest lies, the peaceful demeanor vanishes. Suomi justice involves an axe.

---

## 3. KEMET (THE BLACK RIVER)
**Status:** Active / Occupied Apartheid State.

Nestled amidst the lands of the Black River to the South-West, Kemet stands as the oldest civilization on Tellus. Its monuments predate the memories of the Vardan Empire.

### THE OCCUPATION
Centuries ago, Kemet receded into isolation. The Dorians seized this vulnerability and established a puppet government.

### THE TURNING POINT
With the fall of Doria to the Murk, the occupiers are trapped. Instead of retreating, they have tightened their grip, establishing a brutal Apartheid State to ensure their own survival.
* **The Rebellion:** A young Pharaoh named **Shafra-Ab** is rallying the native populace to expel the "Homeless Conquerors."

### THE KEMETAN SPIRIT
To play a Kemetan is to be proud, spiritual, and simmering with righteous anger.

**1. THE BLACK RIVER**
* **The Lifeblood:** The river is perceived as the blood of the earth itself.
* **The Magic:** Kemetan spirituality focuses on the divinity of the water. Rituals involving river mud are common.

**2. THE ANCIENT CURSE**
Scattered across Kemet are temples that predate even Kemetan memory.
* **The Danger:** Locals believe these sites are haunted by the spirits of a civilization the gods erased. To enter a Pre-Kemetan ruin is to invite a curse.

**3. HOSPITALITY AND HONOR**
* **The Custom:** It is ancient law to offer what one possesses to a traveler.
* **The Trap:** This hospitality has rules. A guest who refuses a gift commits a grave insult.

---

## 4. BEITHAR (THE ENDLESS PLAINS)
**Status:** Active / Unifying Nomadic Horde.

In the distant northeast, the **Yoruba** people traverse the open grasslands. Their history is a pendulum swinging between infighting and terrifying unity.

### THE RISE OF BATAAR
For centuries, the Old Empire managed the Yoruba through bribery. But now, a charismatic Prince named **Bataar** has risen. If he rallies the tribes, they will be an unstoppable force capable of crushing the Shelf.

### THE YORUBA WAY
To play a Yoruba is to be honest, melodious, and devastatingly mobile.

**1. MEMORY SONGS (Oral Magic)**
* **The Magic:** Through singing, the Yoruba can physically transfer memories. An Elder sings the experience into a child's mind.
* **The Result:** A young warrior might possess the tactical instincts of a general who died two centuries ago.

**2. RIDERS OF THE RAM**
* **The Mount:** **Steppe Rams**. Massive, shaggy creatures with spiraling horns. They can charge through infantry lines like battering rams.
* **The Bond:** A Ram will fight to the death to protect its rider.

**3. THE ATLATL MASTERS**
* **The Weapon:** They prefer the **Atlatl**—a hooked implement used to propel javelins at terrifying speeds.
* **The Advantage:** Silent, reusable, and capable of punching through modern armor.

**4. THE TRUTH UNBROKEN**
* **The Taboo:** Their legends recount dire punishments for those who deceive. To call a Yoruba a liar is to challenge them to violence.
