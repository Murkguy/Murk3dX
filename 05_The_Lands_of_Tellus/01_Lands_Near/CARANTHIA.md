## 2. CARANTHA (THE CHAOS OF FREEDOM)
**Status:** Active / Unstable Democracy.

Situated at the farthest reaches of the Eastern Shelf, the archipelago of Carantha is a land of jagged peaks and smoking vents. Historically, it was the Empire's mailed fist—a culture of unwavering martial tradition that valued discipline above civil liberty. Their spires were not adorned with saints, but with carvings of drills, marching columns, and triumphant executions.

### THE RIVALRY
Following the collapse of the Old Empire, Carantha emerged as the primary rival to Doria. For centuries, they waged a bloody war over the borderlands of Ruthenia, turning the fields into a charnel house of steel and mud.

### THE DAY THE KINGS DIED
The Black Day saved Carantha by destroying its ambition. The fateful Battle of Doria (0 AC) saw the gathered might of the Caranthian Royal House annihilated by the initial surge of the Murk. The entire VarZolen Dynasty was wiped out, save for one nephew, Rorn, who inherited a kingdom of corpses.
Rorn's reign lasted days. He was cut down by an assassin’s blade, ending the royal line forever.

### THE NEW EXPERIMENT
Seizing the vacuum, activists and visionaries drove the nation toward a terrifying new era: Democracy. Over the past three decades, Carantha has transformed into a Confederation of City-States.
* **The Reality:** It is not a utopia. It is a mess. Political factions operate like street gangs, vying for influence. The loss of their expert military leadership has left them vulnerable, but their spirit is unbroken. They are free, and they will kill anyone who tries to take that away.

### THE CARANTHIAN SPIRIT
To play a Caranthian is to be loud, proud, and armed.

**1. BY SEA AND AIR**
Carantha is an archipelago of high-altitude peaks that rise above the Murk like islands in a black ocean.
* **The Sky-Captains:** Caranthians are the undisputed masters of the air. They pilot majestic Iron-Clad Dirigibles and gas-haulers that soar between the mountain peaks, ferrying goods and soldiers over the fog.
* **The Aesthetic:** A Caranthian doesn't walk; they swagger. They wear aviator leathers, heavy coats, and goggles as status symbols.

**2. THE GREAT FORGE**
Nestled at the base of a dormant volcano lies the industrial heart of the nation.
* **The Industry:** The intense geothermal heat allows Carantha to excel in metallurgy. While Novemgrod scavenges for Old Tech, Carantha builds new steel.
* **The Craft:** Their weapons are heavy, brutal, and reliable. A Dorian sword is a piece of art; a Caranthian hammer is a tool for murder.

**3. AGGRESSIVE HOSPITALITY**
One of the hallmarks of their culture is their legendary, almost competitive hospitality.
* **The Tradition:** It is said that no one leaves a Caranthian home without being fed to bursting. This is not just kindness; it is a display of dominance. To feed a guest is to prove you are strong enough to spare resources.
* **In Play:** A Caranthian NPC will buy the whole bar a round of drinks, then punch you in the face if you refuse to drink it.

**4. THE CITY-STATE CONFEDERATION**
Carantha is not one nation; it is a collection of rival cities (e.g., Iron-Port, High-Reach, Sulfur-Gate).
* **The Conflict:** Each city has its own laws. In one, dueling is legal; in another, it is a capital crime. Navigating Carantha requires knowing which faction owns the ground you stand on.
