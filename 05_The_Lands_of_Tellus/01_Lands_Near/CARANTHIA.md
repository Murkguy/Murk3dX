## 2. CARANTHA (THE CHAOS OF FREEDOM)
**Status:** Active / Unstable Democracy.

Situated at the farthest reaches of the Eastern Shelf, the archipelago of Carantha is a land of jagged peaks and smoking vents. Historically, it was the Empire's mailed fist—a culture of unwavering martial tradition that valued discipline above civil liberty. Their spires were not adorned with saints, but with carvings of drills, marching columns, and triumphant executions.

### THE RIVALRY
Following the collapse of the Old Empire, Carantha emerged as the primary rival to Doria. For centuries, they waged a bloody war over the borderlands of Ruthenia, turning the fields into a charnel house of steel and mud.

### THE DAY THE KINGS DIED
The Black Day saved Carantha by destroying its ambition. The fateful Battle of Doria (0 AC) saw the gathered might of the Caranthian Royal House annihilated by the initial surge of the Murk. The entire VarZolen Dynasty was wiped out, save for one nephew, Rorn, who inherited a kingdom of corpses.
Rorn's reign lasted days. He was cut down by an assassin’s blade, ending the royal line forever.

### THE NEW EXPERIMENT
Seizing the vacuum, activists and visionaries drove the nation toward a terrifying new era: Democracy. Over the past three decades, Carantha has transformed into a Confederation of City-States.
* **The Reality:** It is not a utopia. It is a mess. Political factions operate like street gangs, vying for influence. The loss of their expert military leadership has left them vulnerable, but their spirit is unbroken. They are free, and they will kill anyone who tries to take that away.

### THE CARANTHIAN SPIRIT
To play a Caranthian is to be loud, proud, and armed.

**1. BY SEA AND AIR**
Carantha is an archipelago of high-altitude peaks that rise above the Murk like islands in a black ocean.
* **The Sky-Captains:** Caranthians are the undisputed masters of the air. They pilot majestic Iron-Clad Dirigibles and gas-haulers that soar between the mountain peaks, ferrying goods and soldiers over the fog.
* **The Aesthetic:** A Caranthian doesn't walk; they swagger. They wear aviator leathers, heavy coats, and goggles as status symbols.

**2. THE GREAT FORGE**
Nestled at the base of a dormant volcano lies the industrial heart of the nation.
* **The Industry:** The intense geothermal heat allows Carantha to excel in metallurgy. While Novemgrod scavenges for Old Tech, Carantha builds new steel.
* **The Craft:** Their weapons are heavy, brutal, and reliable. A Dorian sword is a piece of art; a Caranthian hammer is a tool for murder.

**3. AGGRESSIVE HOSPITALITY**
One of the hallmarks of their culture is their legendary, almost competitive hospitality.
* **The Tradition:** It is said that no one leaves a Caranthian home without being fed to bursting. This is not just kindness; it is a display of dominance. To feed a guest is to prove you are strong enough to spare resources.
* **In Play:** A Caranthian NPC will buy the whole bar a round of drinks, then punch you in the face if you refuse to drink it.

**4. THE CITY-STATE CONFEDERATION**
Carantha is not one nation; it is a collection of rival cities (e.g., Iron-Port, High-Reach, Sulfur-Gate).
* **The Conflict:** Each city has its own laws. In one, dueling is legal; in another, it is a capital crime. Navigating Carantha requires knowing which faction owns the ground you stand on.

## Synopsis

The land of Carantia, situated at the farthest reaches of the Vardan Empire, has always maintained its distinct culture and unwavering commitment to martial traditions. Its people, known for their warlike nature, hold military prowess and disciplined organization in high regard, prioritizing them above civil liberties. Even their artistic expressions bear the mark of their militant spirit, with towering spires adorned with vivid depictions of drills and triumphant victories.

Following the collapse of the empire, Carantia emerged as a formidable rival to Doria, sparking centuries of intense competition and warfare between the two powers. Their primary battleground became the Dorian vassal of Ruthenia, where their shared border became a constant backdrop of conflict, stained with bloodshed and the clash of steel.

Had it not been for The Black Day, Carantia may have achieved its ambition of conquering Doria and resurrecting the Imperium. However, the fateful battle of Doria witnessed the demise of the entire royal house of Carantia, with the exception of one sole survivor—Rorn, a distant nephew who inherited the weight of the fallen dynasty. Tragically, even his life was abruptly cut short by an assassin's hand, abruptly ending the VarZolen line.

Seizing the opportunity presented by this upheaval, activists and visionaries within Carantia drove the former kingdom toward a new era as a democracy. Over the past three decades, their efforts have borne fruit, resulting in the establishment of a democratic system. However, the transition has not been without challenges. Political factions now vie for influence and power, while the loss of their expert military force has left Carantia in a precarious and vulnerable position, susceptible to external threats.

Carantians at a glance
By the sea, by the air
Carantia, situated on a rugged archipelago with towering mountains and breathtaking vistas, boasts a geography as diverse as its cultural heritage. Surrounded by vast seas, the Carantians have long been skilled navigators, mastering both conventional sea vessels and majestic airships that soar through the skies. Their maritime traditions are deeply ingrained in their way of life, and the sight of their ships dotting the horizon is a testament to their prowess.

A land of lands
In the wake of the empire's collapse, Carantia experienced a significant transformation, evolving into a confederation of democratic city-states. Each city-state operates autonomously, with its own government, laws, and distinct character. While this confederation system ensures local autonomy, it also fosters a spirit of competition and occasional rivalry between the city-states. Yet, when faced with external threats or challenges, the Carantians have historically shown a remarkable ability to unite and defend their collective interests.

Legendary hosts
One of the hallmarks of Carantian culture is their legendary hospitality. The Carantians are renowned for their graciousness and warm welcome extended to visitors and guests. It is said that no one leaves Carantia without experiencing their generosity, feasting on sumptuous meals, and enjoying the finest entertainment. This tradition of hospitality is deeply rooted in their society and reflects their values of communal harmony and mutual respect.


The Great Forge
Nestled at the base of a dormant volcano, Carantia is home to magnificent forgeworks that have been honed to perfection over generations. The intense heat and abundant mineral resources provided by the volcanic region have allowed the Carantians to excel in the art of metallurgy and craftsmanship. Skilled blacksmiths and artisans create exquisite weapons, armor, and ornamental pieces that are highly sought after throughout the continent. The glowing furnaces and rhythmic hammering of the forgeworks serve as a testament to Carantia's dedication to the mastery of their craft.

In the face of shifting fortunes and changing political landscapes, Carantia stands as a resilient land, holding onto its militant traditions, maritime legacy, democratic city-states, legendary hospitality, and the resounding clang of hammers shaping metal at the foot of a majestic volcano.
