## 1. DORIA (THE LOST HEART)
**Status:** Fallen / Consumed by Murk.

Set deep within the heart of the old Vardan Empire, the lands that would later become the country of Doria hold an illustrious history. This region served as the birthplace of the original sixteen emperors, a testament to its significance as the pinnacle of power on all of Tellus. Indeed, the entirety of Doria was intricately intertwined with the legacy of the Vardan Empire, sharing not only its territories but also a capital city that remained unchanged—Varranthal.

### THE RISE AND FALL
The zenith of Doria's influence began to wane following the ascension of Emperor Regieran to the realm beyond in 1331 BBD. In the wake of his departure, the empire descended into a tumultuous era of internal strife.

Yet, amid the political turmoil, Doria experienced a resurgence under the reign of King Arminus Magnus (745 BBD). With remarkable acumen, Arminus consolidated the fragmented political landscape, ushering in a new golden era. Doria reclaimed much of its former homeland and even extended southward, subjugating the land of Kemet.

### THE BLACK DAY (0 AC)
However, the tides of fate took an irreversible turn with the advent of The Black Day. As the catastrophic event unfolded, Doria found itself at the epicenter. Its lands were consumed by the insidious Murk—a rolling sea of malevolent black fog that devoured all in its path.

The once-thriving nation became a desolate wasteland. Varranthal, the capital city that once symbolized the might of the Vardan Empire, now lies silent and lifeless beneath the fog—a ghostly reminder of the nation's former grandeur.

### THE DORIAN EXILE (CULTURE & PEOPLE)
*The Nation in Refuge.*

Only the expatriate Dorians managed to escape the grim fate, seeking refuge in nearby lands like Kemet and Novemgrod. Despite their scattered settlements, they steadfastly cling to their customs, carrying the flame of Dorian heritage wherever they go.

To play a Dorian (or interact with one) is to understand four pillars of their society:

**1. THE HOUSES OF LEGACY**
Within the remnants of the Empire, the noble houses serve as the bedrock of political influence. Many individuals take great pride in tracing their ancestry back to the Vardan Empire.
* **The Obsession:** They meticulously maintain extensive genealogical records. These ancestral connections are seen as a source of honor and legitimacy. A Dorian Noble in a refugee slum will still demand to be addressed by their full title.

**2. THE MATRIARCHY**
Dorian society is distinctly Matriarchal.
* **The Matrons:** Women hold significant influence, assuming the role of decision-makers and arrangers of marriages. Matrons play a central role in selecting suitable matches for their children, considering factors such as social standing and strategic alliances.
* **In Play:** If you want a favor from a Dorian House, you do not talk to the Duke; you talk to his Mother.

**3. HONORABLE DUELS**
The concept of personal honor is paramount. Conflicts or disputes are often resolved through ritualistic combat.
* **The Code:** These duels are not brawls; they are strictly regulated affairs used to settle grievances or restore honor. To refuse a duel is to accept social death.

**4. THE GUILD SYSTEM**
In the fabric of Doria's society, an intricate guild system thrives.
* **The Structure:** Each guild operates as a self-governing body. They include the Guild of Arcanists, Guild of Blacksmiths, Guild of Traders, and Guild of Scribes.
* **The Power:** Membership offers social recognition and access to exclusive networks. Even in exile, a Dorian Blacksmith will only teach their secrets to a fellow Guild member.
