## 3. RUTHENIA (THE EDGE OF OBLIVION)
**Status:** Active / Feudal Industrial Nation.
**Capital City:** Novemgrod (See Chapter 1).

Ruthenia was the second land to succumb to the Old Empire’s might. Historically, it was the "Crossroads of War"—a hotly contested buffer zone between Doria and Carantha. Today, it is the last bastion of civilization on the Shelf.

### THE MERCENARY STATE
During the Great War, Ruthenia survived not by fighting, but by dealing. Recognizing their strategic value, the collective cities sold their mercenary forces to the highest bidder, draining the coffers of both Doria and Carantha.

### THE AFTERMATH
The Black Day punished Ruthenia for its hubris. The encroaching Murk took a severe toll on the eastern provinces. Many ancient political dynasties crumbled within five years.
* **The Last Capital:** With the countryside dying, the population flocked to the westernmost stronghold: Novemgrod. The city is now the beating heart of the Ruthenian nation, holding the last of its culture, its monarchy, and its industry.

### THE RUTHENIAN SOUL
To play a Ruthenian is to be stoic, cultured, and ruthlessly pragmatic.

**1. SERFS AND KINGS**
Ruthenia is the last true Feudal state on the Shelf.
* **The Korvus (The Raven King):** The ancient title for the High King of Ruthenia. Currently, Grand Prince Alexei Novikov acts as the de facto Korvus, though he has refused to take the official title until the lost territories are reclaimed.
* **The Korovladi (The Land-Owners):** The nobility. Many have lost their ancestral lands to the Murk or the Waste and now live in the "Crown" district of Novemgrod, playing political games while their serfs work the factories in the "Boiler."

**2. THE GREY MUSES (Culture)**
Despite the bleakness, Ruthenians produce the finest art on Tellus. They believe that suffering refines the soul.
* **Literature:** Ruvana Morozova (Poetry), Aleksander Petrovich (History), Natalya Dragunova (Philosophy).
* **Architecture:** The skyline of Novemgrod is the peak of Ruthenian design—impossible spires, onion domes, and flying buttresses that defy gravity.


## Synopsis
Ruthenia, the second land to succumb to Doria's might and an initial partner in the formation of the Empire, boasts a multitude of vibrant and cosmopolitan cities among the Near Lands. Situated between the eastern reaches of Doria and the western expanse of Carantia, Ruthenia has long been a hotly contested region, witnessing centuries of conflict and ever-changing loyalties.

During the War, Ruthenia adeptly played both sides, skillfully maneuvering for increased power and influence. The collective cities of Ruthenia, recognizing their strategic value, sold their mercenary forces to the highest bidder, ensuring that their ancient conquerors remained weakened and incapable of launching successful campaigns against them.

However, the devastating The Black Day and the encroaching Murk took a severe toll on the eastern third of Ruthenia. The region was left in ruins, and many of the once-mighty political dynasties crumbled within a mere five years. Those who survived were thrust into a desperate struggle for stability, as they grappled with the aftermath of the catastrophe. The resilient and fiercely individualistic Ruthen people, known for their resourcefulness, brace themselves for a new era, ever watchful of the potential resurgence of their rival, Carantania.

In the midst of this tumultuous landscape, the metropolitan cities of Ruthenia continue to shine as beacons of culture and progress, their streets teeming with diversity and intellectual pursuits. Amidst the echoes of past battles and the looming threat of a resurgent Carantania, Ruthenia stands as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of its people.
Ruthenians at a glance
The Ancient and the New
Within the borders of Ruthenia, a land steeped in history and diverse influences, one finds a mesmerizing sight: the striking spired architecture that adorns its cities. Many of these architectural marvels pay homage to the original designs of the Vardan Empire, serving as a reminder of the region's glorious past. These towering structures stand as testaments to the architectural prowess and artistic ingenuity of the Ruthen people.

However, despite the grandeur of their cities, Ruthenia is not without its cultural divisions. A distinct gap exists between the rural peasantry, who toil under the vast expanse of the countryside, and the bustling industrial centers that dominate the urban landscapes. The cities are filled with factories, where the noise of machinery reverberates through the streets, creating a stark contrast to the serenity of the rural fields. This divide in lifestyles and aspirations often fuels tensions and a sense of disconnect between the two worlds.

Serfs and Kings
Ruthenia's political structure is characterized by a system where the nobles, known as Korovladi, hold direct ownership of their lands under the rule of the Korvus - King. This hierarchical arrangement shapes the power dynamics within the realm, with the nobles exerting influence and control over their respective territories. The Kovus acts as the central authority, responsible for maintaining order and overseeing the affairs of the kingdom. This delicate balance of power between the monarchy and the noble class often plays a pivotal role in shaping the course of Ruthenia's history.

The Grey Muses
At the heart of Ruthen culture lies the spirit of resilience and endurance. The people are stern and resolute, weathering the trials and tribulations that life throws their way. It is through this perseverance that the Ruthen people produce great works of writing, capturing the essence of their experiences and the soul of their nation. Some notable authors within the Ruthen literary tradition, following a Slavic naming convention, include:

Ivana Morozova - Renowned for her introspective and evocative poetry collection, "Whispers of the Frozen Land."
Aleksander Petrovich - A master of historical fiction, his epic novel "The Chronicles of Rus" chronicles the turbulent events of Ruthen history.
Natalya Dragunova - Known for her thought-provoking literary essays and insightful social commentary in her book "Reflections of the Silent Steppes."

These authors, among many others, contribute to the rich tapestry of Ruthen literature, capturing the spirit, resilience, and deep-rooted traditions of the Ruthen people. Their works serve as a testament to the enduring cultural legacy that continues to shape the literary landscape of Ruthenia.
