## 3. RUTHENIA (THE EDGE OF OBLIVION)
**Status:** Active / Feudal Industrial Nation.
**Capital City:** Novemgrod (See Chapter 1).

Ruthenia was the second land to succumb to the Old Empire’s might. Historically, it was the "Crossroads of War"—a hotly contested buffer zone between Doria and Carantha. Today, it is the last bastion of civilization on the Shelf.

### THE MERCENARY STATE
During the Great War, Ruthenia survived not by fighting, but by dealing. Recognizing their strategic value, the collective cities sold their mercenary forces to the highest bidder, draining the coffers of both Doria and Carantha.

### THE AFTERMATH
The Black Day punished Ruthenia for its hubris. The encroaching Murk took a severe toll on the eastern provinces. Many ancient political dynasties crumbled within five years.
* **The Last Capital:** With the countryside dying, the population flocked to the westernmost stronghold: Novemgrod. The city is now the beating heart of the Ruthenian nation, holding the last of its culture, its monarchy, and its industry.

### THE RUTHENIAN SOUL
To play a Ruthenian is to be stoic, cultured, and ruthlessly pragmatic.

**1. SERFS AND KINGS**
Ruthenia is the last true Feudal state on the Shelf.
* **The Korvus (The Raven King):** The ancient title for the High King of Ruthenia. Currently, Grand Prince Alexei Novikov acts as the de facto Korvus, though he has refused to take the official title until the lost territories are reclaimed.
* **The Korovladi (The Land-Owners):** The nobility. Many have lost their ancestral lands to the Murk or the Waste and now live in the "Crown" district of Novemgrod, playing political games while their serfs work the factories in the "Boiler."

**2. THE GREY MUSES (Culture)**
Despite the bleakness, Ruthenians produce the finest art on Tellus. They believe that suffering refines the soul.
* **Literature:** Ruvana Morozova (Poetry), Aleksander Petrovich (History), Natalya Dragunova (Philosophy).
* **Architecture:** The skyline of Novemgrod is the peak of Ruthenian design—impossible spires, onion domes, and flying buttresses that defy gravity.
