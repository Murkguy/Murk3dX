## 4. PYTHARIS (THE GILDED WEB)
**Status:** Active / Merchant Republic.

Nestled across the towering peaks of the Mavren Mountains, Pytharis stands as the cultural nucleus of the Near Lands. Historically, it was the "Breadbasket of Tellus"—an agricultural powerhouse revered for art, philosophy, and exoticism.

### THE ETERNAL BATTLEFIELD
Situated between the ever-rivaling powers of Doria and Turcia, Pytharis has been a coveted economic hub and a hotly contested territory for generations. During the War, its attempts at neutrality failed; armies marched across its vineyards, planting flags only to be displaced weeks later.

### THE SURVIVOR
The Black Day spared much of Pytharis from its direct wrath. The geography of the Mavren Mountains shielded the valleys from the worst of the initial Murk-fall. This fortune granted them a significant advantage, allowing them to ward off the encroachments of Turcia and maintain a fragile independence for the past three decades.

### THE PYTHARIAN MASQUERADE
To play a Pytharian is to be charming, wealthy, and fundamentally untrustworthy.

**1. THE GOLDEN PRINCES**
Pytharis is not ruled by a King, but by a series of Merchant Princes.
* **The Game:** They vie for supremacy not through war, but through the "Art of Economics." They manipulate markets, hoard grain to starve rivals, and buy armies like others buy wine.
* **The Atmosphere:** The city-state is a labyrinthine arena of intrigue. A Golden Prince might smile at you, pay you a fortune to kill his brother, and then invite you to the funeral.

**2. THE NETWORK (Espionage)**
Pytharis boasts the finest spies in all of Tellus.
* **The Operatives:** Shrouded in secrecy, they act as the world’s brokers of information. Whispers of Pytharian spies echo in every court—from the throne room of Novemgrod to the democratic halls of Carantha.

**3. THE SILENCE OF LE VIDES**
Pytharis is home to the ancient temples of Le Vides—once vibrant centers of spiritual devotion known for their "Penitent Choirs."
* **The Silence:** On the morning of the Black Day, the Choirs stopped singing mid-verse. Since then, the temples have fallen silent. The monks have ceased their chants, the rites are abandoned, and the doors are barred. The populace believes the monks are in mourning, but the fear in their eyes suggests something far worse.

## Synopsis

Nestled across the towering peaks of the Mavren mountains, Pytharis stands as the cultural nucleus of the Near Lands. With an air of exoticism and a penchant for philosophical pursuits, Pytharis has long been revered as the wellspring of art, culture, and intellectual exploration. While it has never sought dominance, Pytharis has consistently played a vital role as the agricultural powerhouse of Ereb throughout recorded history.

Situated between the ever-rivaling powers of Doria and Turcicus, Pytharis has been a coveted economic hub and a hotly contested territory for countless generations. Even during the tumultuous years of the War, Pytharis's attempts at maintaining neutrality proved futile, as armies marched across its lands, planting flags only to be displaced by the opposing forces soon after.

The Black Day, with its devastating effects, spared much of Pytharis from its direct wrath. This fortunate circumstance granted Pytharis a significant advantage in warding off the encroachments of Turcicus, resulting in a fragile balance that has held precariously for the past three decades."
