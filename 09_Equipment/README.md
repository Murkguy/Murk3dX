# ECONOMY & GEAR

In *The Murk*, you cannot simply walk into a store and buy a machine gun. The factories of Carantha are stalling, and the trade routes of Kemet are choked by fog. Gold is heavy and useless; a man dying of thirst cannot drink a diamond.

* **Cash is dead.**
* **Barter is king.** A can of peaches is worth more than a wedding ring.

## 1. SCROUNGING (THE MARKET)
To find gear, you must hunt for it. This represents searching ruins, trading with nervous locals, or raiding forgotten supply caches.

### THE ROLL
To find a buyer or a cache, roll **MIND (Investigation)** or **GUILE (Streetwise)**.

* **DR 10 (Common):** *The Basics.* Food, Clean Water, Basic Ammo, Bandages, Alcohol.
* **DR 15 (Specialist):** *The Tools.* Specific Guns, Med-Kits, Climbing Gear, Fuel, Batteries.
* **DR 20 (Relics):** *The Old World.* Old Empire Tech, Magical Components, Heavy Weaponry, Masterwork Armor.

### THE RISK
Scrounging takes time and exposes you.
* **Failure:** You find nothing but dust.
* **Botch (Failure + "1"):** You find trouble. You are accosted by thugs, you disturb a nest of Murk-rats, or the item you buy is cursed.

## 2. BARTER LEVELS (THE CURRENCY)
We do not track coins. We track **Value Levels**. To buy an item, you must trade something of equal Level.

### LEVEL 1: SCRAP
* **Examples:** Rusted metal, canned food, water, simple ammo, bandages.
* **Buying Power:** Keeps you alive for another day.

### LEVEL 2: GOODS
* **Examples:** Working firearms, Med-Kits, fuel canisters, tools, functional armor.
* **Buying Power:** Keeps you working.

### LEVEL 3: RELICS
* **Examples:** Old Empire technology, magical foci, secrets, heavy machinery, pristine luxuries (Coffee, Chocolate, Spices).
* **Buying Power:** Changes your life. Can buy entry into high society or a meeting with a Prince.

## 3. INVENTORY (LOAD)
Your inventory is abstract. We do not count pounds; we count **Slots**. You carry what your frame can support.

### CAPACITY
* **Max Load:** Equal to your **BODY DIE**.
    * *Body d6:* 6 Slots.
    * *Body d10:* 10 Slots.
    * *Mule Talent:* +4 Slots.
* **Overburdened:** If you exceed your limit, you gain the **Clumsy Tag** (-2 to Movement and Stealth) and cannot take the **Rush** action.

### THE FLAT SLOT RULE
**1 Item = 1 Slot.**
It does not matter if it is a knife, a rifle, or a med-kit. If it is significant enough to track, it takes 1 Slot.

* **Small Items:** "Pocket items" like keys, coins, or a single lighter do not take slots.
* **Armor Restriction:** You may only carry **One Suit of Armor** at a time (worn). You cannot stack armor or carry spare suits in your pack; they are too bulky.

## 4. WEAPONS
The tools of violence are varied, from rusted shivs to thunderous cannons.

* **Magical Weapons:** If a weapon is enchanted or forged of Old World steel, add **+1 to +3 Dice** of the same type to the damage roll (e.g., A +1 Magic Sword deals 3d4).

### MELEE WEAPONS
| Weapon | Damage | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unarmed** | 1 | Non-Lethal (unless Pugilist). |
| **Knife / Shiv** | 1d4 | Hidden, Thrown (Near). |
| **Club / Baton** | 1d6 | Non-Lethal option. |
| **Sword / Machete** | 2d4 | Reliable. |
| **Great-Axe / Sledge** | 3d4 | 2-Handed, Breaching (Destroys doors). |

### RANGED WEAPONS
| Weapon | Damage | Range | Tags |

| **Rifle / Musket** | 2d6 | Far | 2-Handed. |
| **Shotgun** | 2d6 | Near | Blast (Hits 2 targets in close proximity). |
| **Machine Gun** | 3d6 | Far | Heavy (Cannot move & fire), Auto-Fire. |
| **Cannon / Launcher** | 4d6 | Far | Heavy, Explosive (Zone Damage). |

## 5. ARMOR (THRESHOLD & PENETRATION)
Armor in *The Murk* is not about deflection; it is about absorption. However, every material has a breaking point.

### THE MECHANIC: THRESHOLD
Every suit of armor has a **Threshold** value.

* **Glancing Blow (Damage $\le$ Threshold):** The armor holds. You take **Half Damage** (Round Up).
* **Penetration (Damage > Threshold):** The round punches through or finds a gap. You take **Full Damage**.

| Armor Type | Threshold | Penalty | Protection Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clothing** | 0 | None | Prayer. Always takes Full Damage. |
| **Light** (Leather/Flak) | 5 | None | Mitigates Knives (1d4) and Pistols (1d6). Rifles usually penetrate. |
| **Heavy** (Plate/Hazmat) | 10 | Clumsy | Mitigates Rifles (2d6) and Shotguns. Cannons usually penetrate. |
| **Shield** | +1 Def | Hand | Adds to **Defense Rating** (Harder to hit), not Threshold. |

* **Note:** Heavy Armor applies the **Clumsy Tag** (-2 Move/Stealth) unless you possess the **Soldier** archetype.

## 6. GEAR & TOOLS
*Items that keep you alive. Each takes 1 Slot.*

* **Ammo Pack (Level 1):** A bandolier, a pouch of shells, or a magazine. Contains enough shots for one Scene of intense combat. If you **Botch** an attack roll, you are **Out of Ammo** until you spend an Action to reload with a new pack.
* **Med-Kit (Level 2):** Alcohol, bandages, and adrenaline. Required to use the *Field Chirurgeon* talent or heal Stress via First Aid. (3 Uses).
* **Rations (Level 1):** Dried meat and clean water. Without this, you cannot Heal Stress during a Rest. Hunger is a slow killer.
* **Gas Mask (Level 2):** Essential gear. Makes you immune to the environmental **Lung Rot** of the Murk. Filters last 1 Episode.
* **Lantern (Level 1):** Illuminates Near Range. Requires oil or batteries. The Murk hates light; be warned that this makes you a target.
* **Climbing Gear (Level 2):** Ropes, pitons, and crampons. Grants **+2** on Climbing checks.
* **Lockpicks (Level 2):** Tension wrenches and rakes. Required to pick locks without breaking them.
