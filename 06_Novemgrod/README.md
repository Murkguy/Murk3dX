# THE MISTCLIFFS OF NOVEMGROD

**Novemgrod** is the westernmost bastion of the Eastern Shelf, the great uprising of land that was thrust skyward during the Calamity. It stands as a lonely sentinel, surrounded by the Murk on the West and the endless, scorched silence of the Arid Waste to the East.

Many quarters of the lower city were swallowed by the endless mist decades ago, leaving only the highest peaks of the Shelf habitable. Only through the Herculean efforts of the Builder's Guilds did the city survive at all, as men and women masoned for weeks without sleep to shore up the crumbling foundations against the dissolving tides of the fog.

### A PATCHWORK SKYLINE
What remains is a landscape of absurdist architecture. Desperate to house refugees from the fallen lowlands, the city built up. Ramshackle tenements cling like barnacles to the few remaining ancient spires of the Old Imperium. It is a city of monumental impression met with determined desperation—gold-leafed statues staring down into muddy, coal-choked alleyways.

When the Murktide shifts, warning bells ring throughout the districts. Teams of workers—the "**Shore-Men**"—move quickly to reinforce the foundations of the westernmost plazas before the mist returns to claim them.

## THE PALATINE REGIUM
Dominating the skyline is the legendary **Palatine Regium**, a fortress-citadel dating back to the Old Imperium of millennia ago. It is the heart of the city, not just politically, but physically.

However, the Regium is not merely a castle; it is an anomaly.

* **The Resonance:** As one approaches the massive, iron-shod gates of the citadel, a sound begins to manifest. It is not heard with the ears, but felt in the teeth and the marrow of the bone—a low, rhythmic thrumming, like the heartbeat of a sleeping titan. The closer one gets to the Keep, the louder the resonance becomes. It is this invisible vibration that seems to physically repulse the heaviest banks of the Murk, creating a bubble of breathable air around the upper city.
* **The Silence:** The Regium is guarded by a specific regiment known as **The Null Watch**. They wear heavy, lead-lined greatcoats and fully enclosed helms of polished brass with no visible eye-slits. They never speak. They never remove their helms in public. They stand perfectly still for hours, only moving with terrifying speed to bar entry to the unauthorized.

The Principate of the City, **Alexei Novikov**, has forbidden the searching of the Regium’s lower levels. He claims the Resonance is dangerous to the uninitiated mind.

## THE GILDED CAGE (WHY WE STAY)
Outsiders often ask why the populace does not simply flee East, away from the encroaching fog. The answer is grim and absolute: *There is nowhere to go.*

### THE BARRIER OF ASH
To the East lies the **Arid Waste**. The weapons used in the Great War did not just destroy the enemy; they murdered the soil itself. The Waste is a thousand miles of glassed earth and salt storms. No water flows there. To flee into the Waste is a slow, agonizing death by thirst. To stay in Novemgrod is to gamble with madness, but at least there is water.

### THE PULSE
The populace stays because of the **Resonance**. Whatever is buried beneath the Palatine Regium is the only thing keeping the air breathable. The hum is a constant reminder of their precarious survival. If the thrumming were to stop, even for an hour, the Murk would rush in and drown the city. The people are tethered to the sound like divers to an air hose.

### THE LURE OF THE DEEP
There is also Greed. The Murk destroys life, but it preserves matter. The Sunken Districts beneath the fog are frozen in time, filled with the wealth of the Old World: gold, art, and invaluable **Archeotech**.

* **The Economy of Salvage:** Novemgrod is the only place on Tellus where a pauper can become a Prince in a single afternoon by finding a working Fusion Core. The danger is absolute, but the payout is infinite. This has given rise to the **Divers**—the brave and the foolish who descend into the dark to keep the city’s economy alive.

## THE PRINCE AND THE MAGISTER

### PRINCE ALEXEI NOVIKOV (Nobles, Bereft of Nobility)
Prince Alexei Novikov was never meant to be Grand Prince. His uncle, Milov, despised him for much of his life. "You are too soft," Milov would sneer. "You know nothing of the world, only of books."

Constant comparisons were made to Alexei's cousin, Rikov, a prince of great prowess in battle and two years his senior. Rikov was handsome, athletic, and beloved by the people. While he and Alexei were friends, Rikov never understood the bookish, sickly Alexei. Bound to be an administrator for life, Alexei retreated into philosophy, content to be a shadow.

**The Phantom War:** Then, The War began. Milov and Rikov left Novemgrod in Alexei's hands. They marched West with their armies and their Battle-Magisters to face the encroaching dark. They never came back. The mist took them.

Alexei inherited the shattered remains of his home. He had to rebuild in the shadow of ghosts.

* **The Ruler:** Alexei is a wise ruler for a man so young, an "Enlightened Despot." He disregards the corrupt will of the Noble Councils in favor of the plight of his subjects. Yet, he is paranoid. He trusts no one. A palace coup is always brewing, and though he looks frail, within his gaze lies an otherworldly insight that unsettles his generals.

### HIGH MAGISTER VALESKA (The Unspoken Alliance)
Alexei frequently seeks out **High Magister Valeska** when in need of council. Their meetings are polite and friendly, a sharp contrast to the hostility between the Church and the Academy.

* **The Bond:** The Magister needs him for political survival; he needs her to interpret the fluctuations of the Resonance. Something deeper connects them—they are kindred spirits, the "Smart Ones" left behind by the "Strong Ones" to clean up the mess. But the station of their roles forbids any union. They are married to the City, not each other.
