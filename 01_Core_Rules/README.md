# BOOK I: THE RULES

> "The fog doesn't just hide things. It changes them. It takes the familiar—a dog, a rifle, a memory—and twists it until it fits the shape of the Murk."

## WHAT IS THIS GAME?
**THE MURK** is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game of industrial horror and attrition. Players take on the roles of Scavengers, Soldiers, and Occultists attempting to survive in a world swallowed by a metaphysical fog.

It is a game about:
1.  **Scarcity:** You will never have enough bullets, bandages, or hope.
2.  **Attrition:** There are no "long rests" that fix everything. Damage is sticky. Trauma is permanent.
3.  **The Spiral:** You are not a superhero. You are a person trying to keep their head above water while wearing lead boots.

## THE DICE
To play, you need:
* **Two six-sided dice (2d6)**: The chaos of the world.
* **Polyhedral Set (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12):** These represent your Attributes.

# CHAPTER 1: THE CORE MECHANIC

## 1. THE PHILOSOPHY: FICTION FIRST
In *The Murk*, the story leads the dice. You do not look at your character sheet to see "what buttons you can press." You describe what your character does in the fiction, and the Director tells you when (and what) to roll.

### THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARD
Your characters are not peasants; they are Archetypes. They are competent, dangerous professionals.

* **No Roll Required:** If a task is mundane for a professional—like a Soldier cleaning a rifle, a Magister fixing a radio, or a Ruffian picking a cheap padlock—you simply succeed. We do not roll for walking down the street.
* **The Trigger:** You only pick up the dice when there is Risk, Pressure, or a Cost for failure.

---

## 2. THE ROLL (THE 3dX SYSTEM)
When the outcome is uncertain, you build a pool of three dice to determine your fate.

### THE POOL
* **The Base:** 2d6 (Two six-sided dice). These represent the standard variance of the world.
* **The Skill:** 1 Attribute Die (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12). This represents your training and talent.

### THE FORMULA
$$Result = 2d6 + Attribute Die + Modifiers$$

Compare your Result to the **Difficulty Rating (DR)** set by the Director.

### THE DIFFICULTY RATINGS
* **DR 10 (Standard):** Challenging but expected. Shooting a moving target, climbing a wet wall, decoding a cipher under time pressure.
* **DR 15 (Hard):** A feat of expertise. Shooting a target in heavy fog, picking a guild-vault lock, resisting a magical compulsion.
* **DR 20 (Impossible):** A feat of legend. Surviving a fall from a tower, convincing a Murk-beast to hesitate, holding a door against a horde.

---

## 3. THE OUTCOMES
The dice tell us not just if you succeed, but how.

### SUCCESS (Roll ≥ DR)
You achieve your goal. The door opens, the shot hits, the information is found. The scene moves forward in your favor.

### FAILURE (Roll < DR)
You do not achieve your goal, or—more often—you achieve it with a Complication.
* **Narrative Failure:** The door is jammed tight.
* **Fail Forward:** You kick the door open, but the noise alerts the guards in the next room.

### THE CRUSHING SUCCESS (Roll ≥ DR + 10)
You beat the difficulty by 10 or more. You succeed with style, speed, or lethal efficiency.
* **Combat:** Add an extra Damage Die.
* **Skill:** You do it in half the time, or gain a key insight (e.g., "You not only pick the lock, you realize the tumblers were oiled recently—someone is inside.")

### THE BOTCH (Fail + Attribute "1")
If your Total is a Failure **AND** your Attribute Die shows a naturally rolled "1".

This is a catastrophe. It represents a lapse in judgment or a twist of fate.
* **Examples:** Your gun jams. Your lockpick snaps off in the keyhole. You trip and drop the artifact down a well. You take immediate Stress.

---

## 4. THE EXPLODING DIE (THE AHA! MOMENT)
*Optional Rule for Cinematic Play.*

If your Attribute Die rolls its maximum number (e.g., a 4 on a d4, or an 8 on a d8), the die **Explodes**.

* **Effect:** Roll that die again and add the new number to the previous one. Keep rolling as long as you hit the maximum.
* **Why this matters:** This allows even a novice (d4) a statistically slim chance to hit an Impossible DR (20), representing sheer dumb luck or a moment of desperate genius.

# CHAPTER 2: THE ECONOMY OF SURVIVAL (POTENTIAL)

In *The Murk*, survival is not guaranteed by your stats. You need **Potential**.

Potential is the currency of heroism. It represents adrenaline, divine favor, luck, or sheer grit. It is the fuel you burn to force the universe to blink before you do.

---

## 1. THE CAPACITY (THE RESERVOIR)
You can hold a significant amount of luck, but the pressure is high. Your **Maximum Potential** is determined by your Rank.

### THE HARD CAP
* **Rank 1 (Green):** Max 12 Potential.
* **Rank 2 (Seasoned):** Max 16 Potential.
* **Rank 3 (Veteran):** Max 20 Potential.
* **Rank 4 (Legend):** Max 24 Potential.

### THE COLD START
You always start a new Episode with **0 Potential**. You must earn your momentum.

---

## 2. GAINING POTENTIAL (THE CYCLE)
You gain Potential in four specific ways. Note that you can **never** exceed your Hard Cap; excess Potential generated is lost immediately.

### A. THE GRINDER (Fail Forward)
*We learn more from our scars than our victories.*
* **Trigger:** Whenever you roll the dice and **Fail** (Total < DR).
* **Gain:** 1 Potential.
* **Note:** You do not gain Potential if you Botch.

### B. THE SURGE (The Adrenaline Dump)
*Sometimes, the chaos aligns in your favor.*
* **Trigger:** If your Base Dice (2d6) show **Doubles**.
* **Gain:** You gain Potential equal to the **Face Value** of the doubles.
    * *Double 1s:* Gain 1 Potential (and probably Botch).
    * *Double 6s:* Gain 6 Potential.
* **Note:** This triggers regardless of whether the roll succeeds or fails.

### C. THE BURDEN (The Flaw)
*Your character is damaged goods.*
* **Trigger:** When your Burden (Flaw) significantly complicates the scene (e.g., your Limp prevents you from outrunning the guard, or your Greed makes you trigger a trap).
* **Gain:** Roll **1d6 Potential**.
* **Note:** You are gambling with your safety; sometimes it pays off hugely, sometimes it was a waste.

### D. THE CRUSH (Dominance)
* **Trigger:** If you achieve a Crushing Success (Total ≥ DR + 10).
* **Gain:** Roll **1d4 Potential**.

---

## 3. SPENDING POTENTIAL (THE COST OF HEROISM)
You may spend Potential at any time, even on another player's turn (if it makes narrative sense).

### BOOST (+1)
* **Cost:** 2 Potential.
* **Effect:** Add **+1** to your Result.
* **Rule:** You can spend as much as you want. Spending 10 Potential adds +5 to the roll. This allows for massive, "Nova" style moments.

### ACTIVATE (The Resource Swap)
* **Cost:** 5 Potential.
* **Effect:** Regain **1 Class Resource** (Command Point, Favor, Resonance, or Token).
* **Context:** You dig deep into your reserves to find one last prayer or one last magazine.

### MITIGATE (The Dampener)
* **Cost:** 1 Potential.
* **Effect:** Reduce incoming **Stress** or **Magical Backlash** by 1.
* **Example:** You fail a Save and are about to take 4 Stress. You spend 4 Potential to reduce the damage to 0. You are exhausted, but unharmed.

### NEGATE BOTCH (The Save)
* **Cost:** 5 Potential.
* **Effect:** Turn a **Botch** (Catastrophic Failure) into a standard Failure.
* **Narrative:** You stop the gun from jamming, or catch the ledge at the last second. You still fail the climb, but you don't fall to your death.

## 4. THE CONVERSION (SURVIVAL INTO GROWTH)
At the end of an Episode (a full session or completed mission arc), the adrenaline fades and the lessons set in.

### THE XP RULE
Any **Unspent Potential** remaining in your pool at the end of the Episode is immediately converted into **Experience Points (XP)** on a 1-for-1 basis.

### THE RESET
After conversion, your Potential drops to **0** for the start of the next Episode.
