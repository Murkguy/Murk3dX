# ESOTERIA: THE FORBIDDEN SCIENCE
**"Magic is not a miracle; it is a violation of natural law. It is the application of ancient Vardan geometry and alien physics to produce impossible results."**

In the world of *The Murk*, magic is not a gift from the gods. It is a resource that must be extracted, calculated, and paid for in blood and nerve endings.

---

## 1. THE COST OF POWER (AGONY)
Magic is fueled by the caster's life force. The universe resists being rewritten, and it pushes back through the caster's nervous system. We call this feedback **Agony**.

To cast a spell is to invite a seizure. It is to feel your blood boil and your synapses fire all at once.

### THE MECHANIC
To cast a Principle, you do not check to see if the spell works. **The spell always works.** The question is whether you survive the pain.

1.  **Declare:** Choose the Principle (School) and the Magnitude (1, 2, or 3).
2.  **Pay the Cost:** Roll **1d4 Stress per Magnitude**.
    * **Mag 1:** 1d4 Stress.
    * **Mag 2:** 2d4 Stress.
    * **Mag 3:** 3d4 Stress.
3.  **The Save:** Add the cost to your Stress Track. Immediately roll a **Mind Save**.
    * **Success:** You channel the **Agony** safely. The spell takes effect.
    * **Failure:** You take a **Rank of Suffering (Mental)**. The spell still goes off, but you are bleeding from the nose, shaking, or hallucinating from the sheer pain.

---

## 2. THE MAGNITUDE SCALE
All magic is measured by its intensity.

| MAGNITUDE | SCALE | DAMAGE | EXAMPLE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 (Tactical)** | Single Target / Small Object | **2d6** | Lighting a torch, pushing a man. |
| **2 (Lethal)** | Small Group / Environment | **3d6** (Ignores Light Armor) | Withering a limb, crushing a door. |
| **3 (Catastrophic)** | Entire Zone | **4d6** (Ignores All Armor) | Gravity inversion, turning a man to dust. |

### RESISTING MAGIC (THE ENEMY SAVE)
Magic hits automatically, but targets can try to survive the impact.
**Difficulty Rating (DR) = 10 + (2 x Magnitude)**
* **Mag 1:** DR 12 (Challenging)
* **Mag 2:** DR 14 (Severe)
* **Mag 3:** DR 16 (Overwhelming)

* **Target Success:** Half Damage, ignore secondary effects (Blind/Pin).
* **Target Failure:** Full Damage, suffer full effects.

## 3. THE SEVEN SEALS (MAGISTER RANKS)
To practice Esoteria is dangerous. To practice it without a license is heresy. The **Schola Magisterium** controls the flow of knowledge. One must be formally accepted and tested to rise in rank.

### 1. NEOPHYTE (The Initiate)
* **Status:** The starting rank. You are newly initiated into the path. You know enough to be dangerous to yourself.
* **Prerequisite:** Acceptance by a Mentor.

### 2. APPRENTICE (The Student)
* **Status:** You have survived your first Backlash. You are honing your abilities under strict guidance.
* **Benefit:** **Hardened Mind.** You gain **+1 Die** to Mind Checks specifically when rolling to resist **Agony** (Casting Cost).

### 3. ACOLYTE (The Trusted)
* **Status:** You have proven your dedication. You are entrusted with dangerous texts and unsupervised field work.
* **Benefit:** **Overcharge.** Once per Scene, you may increase the **Magnitude** of a spell by +1 *without* paying the extra Stress cost. (e.g., Cast a Mag 2 spell for the price of Mag 1).

### 4. JOURNEYMAN (The Independent)
* **Status:** You are a master of the basics. You are allowed to take contracts and research independently.
* **Benefit:** **The Binding.** You gain the Rite of Summoning. You can conjure and bind minor **Daemons** or Murk-Entities to serve you for a Scene.

### 5. MAGUS (The Master)
* **Status:** A significant milestone. You have made a contribution to the field. You are a "Wizard" in the truest sense.
* **Benefit:** **Precision Casting.** Your mastery of the formula is absolute. When you make an **Esoteria Skill Check** (to identify, counter, or ritualize), you succeed on a roll of **4+** (instead of 5+).

### 6. ARCHMAGUS (The Leader)
* **Status:** Highly respected. You understand the underlying math of the universe. You likely lead a Chapterhouse or research wing.
* **Benefit:** **Cascading Power.** Once per Scene, if you succeed on an Esoteria Check, the die **Explodes** (Roll an additional die; if it hits, add it to the total). This allows for impossible feats of ritual magic.

### 7. HIGH MAGISTER (The Pinnacle)
* **Status:** One of the Seven Rulers of the Order. You shape the direction of magical research for the entire Shelf.
* **Benefit:** **Perfect Mind.** Your understanding is flawless. Your **Esoteria Skill Checks** now succeed on a roll of **3+**.

---

## 4. RELICS (MAGIC FOR THE MUNDANE)
You don't have to be an Esoterist to use magic, provided you find a **Relic**—an object imbued with a permanent spell.

* **Activate:** Spend an Action.
* **Effect:** Casts a fixed spell (e.g., Rod of Kinetics: Mag 2 Push).
* **The Price:** The user takes **Flat Stress** equal to **2x Magnitude**. (No roll, just pain).
    * *Mag 1 Item:* 2 Stress.
    * *Mag 2 Item:* 4 Stress.

## 5. THE RITE OF VOLITION (DAEMON SUMMONING)
**"It is not a spirit. It has no soul. It is my will, given teeth."**

A **Daemon** is not an extra-planar entity. It is a construct of semi-solid light and biomass, projected from the Esoterist's mind. It exists only to perform a set number of tasks (Favors) before its energy matrix collapses.

**WARNING:** A Daemon has a survival instinct. Powerful ones resent their existence and will actively try to break the mental leash to become **Rogue**.

### THE SUMMONING RITUAL
You cannot summon a Daemon in combat. It requires **10 Minutes**, a ritual circle, and a drop of the caster's blood.

1.  **Choose the Magnitude:** Decide how powerful a Daemon you are forging (Minor, Major, or Prime).
2.  **Pay the Agony:** Summoning takes a toll. Take the **Flat Stress Cost** immediately.
3.  **The Binding Roll:** You must dominate the creature the moment it forms.
    * Roll **ARCANA** vs. The Daemon's **SEVERITY (DR)**.
    * **Success:** The Daemon is bound. It has **3 Favors**.
    * **Failure:** The Binding fails. The energy dissipates, and you take **d6 Psychic Damage**.
    * **Critical Failure (1):** The Binding snaps. The Daemon is formed as a **ROGUE**. It is free, hostile, and permanent.

### THE DAEMON HIERARCHY

#### 1. MINOR DAEMON (The Fetch)
*Small, shifting forms used for spying, theft, or remote manipulation.*
* **Cost:** 2 Stress.
* **Severity (DR):** 12.
* **Stats:** HP 6 | Dmg d4.
* **Role:** Can pass through keyholes, carry messages, or steal small objects.

#### 2. MAJOR DAEMON (The Myrmidon)
*Human-sized constructs of war. Often take the shape of faceless knights or beasts.*
* **Cost:** 4 Stress.
* **Severity (DR):** 14.
* **Stats:** HP 12 | Armor 1 | Dmg d8.
* **Role:** Combat, heavy lifting, intimidation.

#### 3. PRIME DAEMON (The Eidolon)
*A towering monstrosity. These often look unlike anything human—abstract geometries or shifting flesh.*
* **Cost:** 6 Stress.
* **Severity (DR):** 16.
* **Stats:** HP 20 | Armor 2 | Dmg 2d6 (Cleave).
* **Role:** Siege warfare, slaughter, or complex problem solving.

### COMMANDING THE DAEMON (THE FAVORS)
A bound Daemon starts with **3 Favors**. Every time you give it a command, it costs **1 Favor**.
* *Examples:* "Kill him," "Unlock that door," "Guard me."

**Remote Action:** You can send a Daemon away to perform a task remotely. This costs **2 Favors** (one for the travel, one for the task). While remote, you share a vague sensory link with it.

**Dissipation:** When the Daemon reaches **0 Favors**, it dissolves into harmless steam.

**The Test of Wills:**
If you order a Daemon to do something suicidal or contrary to its nature, the Director may call for a **Contested Willpower Check** (Mind vs. Severity). If you fail, the Daemon refuses and loses a Favor instantly.

## Synopsis

A thorough exploration of Esoteria unravels its intricate complexities and unveils a myriad of fascinating details. Delving into its depths, one discovers that Esoteria is not a mere haphazard manipulation of magical energies, but a structured discipline built upon precise formulae and intricate patterns. The Magisters, with their insatiable thirst for knowledge and mastery, dedicate themselves to unraveling these enigmatic formulae. Decades of tireless study and unwavering commitment allow them to decipher the underlying principles that govern the manipulation of Esoteria.

Within the vast spectrum of Esoteria, practitioners encounter various branches of specialization. Some Magisters focus their efforts on transmutation, the art of transforming one substance into another, defying the boundaries of nature. Others delve into the secrets of conjuration, summoning ethereal beings or materializing objects through sheer force of will. There are those who explore the depths of elemental manipulation, wielding the primal forces of fire, water, earth, and air with astounding precision. And yet, these are merely fragments of the vast tapestry of possibilities that Esoteria presents.

The pursuit of Esoteria is not without its risks and challenges. It is a path fraught with perils and temptations. The allure of power and dominion lingers at every turn, beckoning the unwary and ambitious. Magisters must grapple with the delicate balance between wielding Esoteria for the betterment of society and succumbing to the seductive allure of personal gain. This internal struggle shapes the moral fiber of each practitioner and determines the ultimate outcome of their journey.

In contrast to the Magisters, the holy practitioners approach Esoteria from a different perspective—one infused with spiritual devotion and divine reverence. For them, Esoteria is not a tool to be wielded for personal empowerment but a sacred conduit through which they channel the benevolent energies bestowed upon them by their deities. Their rituals and ceremonies, intricately woven with faith and devotion, become vessels through which Esoteria flows, manifesting miracles and acts of divine intervention.

The use of Esoteria, however, is not without controversy. Within the realms of Ereb, voices of dissent emerge, cautioning against the potential dangers that lie in the uncontrolled exploitation of this extraordinary power. Skeptics raise concerns about the erosion of the natural order, the disruption of cosmic balance, and the unintended consequences that may arise from meddling with forces beyond mortal comprehension. Such dissent fosters a pervasive debate, as scholars, philosophers, and religious leaders grapple with the ethical and moral implications of wielding Esoteria.

As the Great War ravaged the lands of Ereb, the escalation of industrialized magic and the development of increasingly devastating Esoteria weapons cast a grim shadow upon the world. The years of trench warfare, where soldiers endured unimaginable horrors and suffered the harrowing consequences of these deadly inventions, gave rise to a desperate search for an edge that could tip the scales of victory. It was during this tumultuous period that the rapid advance of airships emerged as a game-changing innovation, shattering the stagnation of trench warfare and paving the way for new strategies and tactics on the battlefield.

However, the turning point of the war came with the tragic event known as "The Black Day." Varranthal, a city besieged by rival Magisters from different nations, became the epicenter of a cataclysmic event that would forever alter the course of history. On that fateful day, something unfathomable occurred—an inexplicable phenomenon known as the Murk materialized, swallowing the city and all its inhabitants. The once-thriving metropolis was consumed by an impenetrable darkness, leaving no trace of those who perished within its malevolent embrace. To this day, the fate of the people and animals trapped within the Murk remains a haunting enigma, as no bones or remains have ever been discovered, defying all attempts at explanation.

The devastation wrought by the Murk extended far beyond the confines of Varranthal. It spread like a voracious plague, consuming not only the city but also vast regions of Doria and a portion of Ruthenia. The sight of this insidious darkness, swallowing everything in its path, left onlookers in a state of profound terror and disbelief. It was a chilling testament to the unbridled power of Esoteria and a stark reminder of the dire consequences that could befall the realm if wielded recklessly.

The catastrophic events of the Great War, culminating in the emergence of the Murk, forced the warring nations to reassess their priorities and reconsider the devastating implications of Esoteria. The ceasefires that followed "The Black Day" brought an end to the bloodshed but left behind a scarred world grappling with the aftermath of unparalleled destruction. Leaders and nations, their armies decimated, were left to mourn their fallen and contemplate the profound costs of their relentless pursuit of power.

The remnants of the Great War now stand as a sobering reminder of the dangers that lurk within the uncharted realms of Esoteria. It is a reminder of the delicate balance between progress and restraint, between ambition and responsibility. The fate of Esoteria, and the very essence of Ereb, hangs precariously in the balance as scholars, mystics, and leaders attempt to navigate the treacherous waters of this mystical art, striving to harness its potential for the greater good while safeguarding against its catastrophic misuse. The future of the realm hinges on the wisdom and discernment of those who dare to traverse the intricate path of Esoteria, as they endeavor to shape a world where magic and mortality coexist in harmony.

Technology and Commerce
Technology and commerce have been profoundly shaped by the utilization of Esoteria. This enigmatic power has paved the way for remarkable advancements, enabling the creation of awe-inspiring inventions that were once inconceivable. Among these technological marvels are the towering airships that traverse the skies, golems fashioned from enchanted materials, weapons capable of slicing through steel like butter, and impenetrable armors that shield their wearers from the deadliest of projectiles.

The emergence of Esoteria-powered technology has not only revolutionized the realm of science and engineering but also become the driving force behind Ereb's economy. The demand for skilled individuals who can enchant and maintain these extraordinary creations is insatiable. Even those with only latent magical abilities can find gainful employment as enchanters, harnessing their innate potential to infuse Esoteria into the intricate mechanisms that power the technological wonders of the realm.

However, while Esoteria-based creations dominate the market, there is still a place for mundane items that cater to the needs of those who cannot afford the more extravagant and intricate technological marvels. Mass production of these everyday commodities ensures that the general populace can access practical tools and essentials for their daily lives.

Mineral trading, particularly reagent mining, has emerged as a vital aspect of commerce in Ereb. Several towns and settlements across every country have become focal points for mining operations, where precious minerals and reagents are extracted from the depths of the earth. These resources serve as the lifeblood of the Esoteria industry, fueling the production and enchantment processes that give rise to the realm's most coveted technological advancements.

Transportation infrastructure, too, has adapted to accommodate the needs of this thriving industry. Extensive rail lines crisscross the lands, facilitating the transportation of heavier items that surpass the limits of even the largest airships. These rail networks ensure efficient logistics and enable the smooth flow of resources, connecting major mining regions, manufacturing hubs, and commercial centers throughout Ereb.
