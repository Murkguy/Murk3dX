# ESOTERIA (MAGIC)

Esoteria is not a miracle; it is a violation of natural law. It is the application of ancient Vardan geometry and alien physics to produce impossible results. Those who practice it—**Esoterists**—do not "pray" for spells. They calculate them. And the universe hates to be calculated.

## 1. THE COST OF POWER (RESONANCE)
Magic is fueled by the caster's life force (Bio-electric energy). We call this feedback **Resonance**.

### THE MECHANIC
To cast a Principle, you do not check to see if the spell works. **The spell always works.** The question is whether you survive it.

1.  **Declare:** Choose the Principle and the Magnitude (1, 2, or 3).
2.  **Pay the Cost:** Roll **1d4 Stress per Magnitude**.
    * **Mag 1:** 1d4 Stress.
    * **Mag 2:** 2d4 Stress.
    * **Mag 3:** 3d4 Stress.
3.  **The Save:** Add the cost to your Stress Track. Immediately roll a **Mind Save**.
    * **Success:** You channel the energy safely. The spell takes effect.
    * **Failure:** You take a **Rank of Suffering (Mental)**. The spell still goes off, but you are bleeding from the nose, shaking, or hallucinating.

## 2. THE MAGNITUDE SCALE
All magic is measured by its intensity.

### MAGNITUDE 1 (Tactical / Utility)
* **Scale:** Affects a single target or small object.
* **Damage:** 2d6 (Rifle equivalent).
* **Examples:** Lighting a torch, pushing a man, rusting a lock.

### MAGNITUDE 2 (Lethal / Control)
* **Scale:** Affects a small group or alters the environment.
* **Damage:** 3d6 (Machine Gun equivalent). Ignores Armor Thresholds < 10.
* **Examples:** Blinding a squad, withering a limb, crushing a door.

### MAGNITUDE 3 (Catastrophic)
* **Scale:** Affects an entire Zone.
* **Damage:** 4d6 (Cannon equivalent). Ignores All Armor.
* **Examples:** Gravity inversion, turning a man to dust, chain lightning.

## 3. THE PRINCIPLES
Esoterists generally specialize in specific "Laws" of reality.

### A. KINETICS (Motion & Force)
*The manipulation of gravity, friction, and impact.*
* **Combat:** Hurls invisible projectiles or crushes armor.
* **Utility:** Can be used to leap great distances, catch falling allies, or force open stuck bulkheads.
* **The Vibe:** The air hums; glass cracks nearby; gravity feels "heavy."

### B. ENTROPY (Time & Decay)
*The acceleration of natural breakdown.*
* **Combat:** Ages flesh rapidly (Necrotic damage) or rusts enemy weapons into dust.
* **Utility:** Destroys locks, weakens structural supports, or spoils enemy food supplies.
* **The Vibe:** Temperature drops; plants wither; metal tarnishes instantly.

### C. LUMINESCENCE (Light & Energy)
*The manipulation of photons and radiation.*
* **Combat:** Firing lasers (Radiant damage) or blinding flashes.
* **Utility:** Lighting dark ruins, signaling over miles, or creating holograms/illusions.
* **The Vibe:** Shadows stretch unnaturally; the air smells of ozone; static electricity builds.

## 4. RESISTING MAGIC
Magic hits the caster automatically, but the target gets a chance to survive.

### THE SAVE MECHANIC
When you cast a spell that deals Damage or Negative Effects (Blind/Push), the Target makes a **Save**.
* **Body:** Used to dodge Kinetics or Light.
* **Spirit:** Used to resist Entropy or Mental effects.

### TARGET DIFFICULTY (DR)
The difficulty to resist your spell is determined by the formula:

$$DR = 10 + (2 \times \text{Magnitude})$$

* **Mag 1 (DR 12):** Challenging. A standard enemy (3d6) fails this ~60% of the time.
* **Mag 2 (DR 14):** Severe. A standard enemy fails this ~84% of the time.
* **Mag 3 (DR 16):** Overwhelming. A standard enemy fails this ~96% of the time.

### THE OUTCOME
* **Target Success:** They take **Half Damage** and avoid secondary effects (Pinned/Blinded).
* **Target Failure:** They take **Full Damage** and suffer the full effect.

## 5. RELICS (MAGIC FOR NON-ESOTERISTS)
You don't have to be an Esoterist to use magic, provided you find a **Relic**—an object imbued with a permanent spell.

### USING A RELIC
1.  **Activate:** Spend an Action to trigger the item.
2.  **Effect:** The item casts a specific fixed spell (e.g., Rod of Kinetics: Mag 2 Push).
3.  **The Kickback:** The user takes **Flat Stress** equal to **2x Magnitude**. (No roll, just pain).
    * **Mag 1 Relic:** 2 Stress.
    * **Mag 2 Relic:** 4 Stress.
    * **Mag 3 Relic:** 6 Stress.

**Note:** Because non-Esoterists usually lack the *Mental Fortress* perk (4 Mind Dice), using high-level Relics is extremely dangerous for them. It creates a "Cursed Item" feel—it works, but it hurts.
