# Murk3dX# CHAPTER 1: THE WORLD THAT REMAINS

## THE BLACK DAY (0 AC)
They say the sun did not set on the Black Day; it was simply swallowed.

It began in the lowlands. A fog, thicker than smoke and blacker than oil, rose from the deep fissures of the earth. It did not drift; it hunted. It rolled over the great cities of the plains—Doria, Kemet, the vast agricultural heartlands—and silenced them. There were no screams, only the cessation of telegraph lines, one by one.

Within a week, much of Tellus was gone. The oceans were blanketed, the valleys drowned. The only thing that remained was **The Shelf**—a jagged uplift of granite in the East, thrust skyward by tectonic agony millennia ago.


## THE CURRENT YEAR (32 AC)
It has been thirty-two years since the Calamity. The The Great War is a memory. The world is broken into three distinct zones of hell:

1.  **THE MURK (The West):** The ocean of toxic fog that covers the lowlands. It is inhabited by things that have evolved—or mutated—to breathe the poison. To enter the Murk without a gas mask is death; to enter it *with* one is madness. Yet, we go there. We go because the ruins of the Old World are down there, filled with the technology and resources we need to survive.
2.  **THE ARID WASTE (The East):** The glassed desert. The weapons of the Great War scorched the earth so thoroughly that nothing will ever grow there again. It is a land of salt storms and silence.
3.  **THE SHELF (The Center):** The thin strip of habitable rock between the Fog and the Fire. Here, in the vertical city of **Novemgrod** and the surrounding peaks, humanity clings to existence. We build upwards, adding scrap-metal shanties to ancient spires, praying the fog doesn't rise any higher.

## WHAT IS THIS GAME?
**The Murk** is a Tabletop RPG about **competent professionals in a hopeless situation**.

* **You are not a farm boy destined to save the world.** The world is already destroyed.
* **You are not a superhero.** A single bullet can kill you. A single mistake can break your mind.
* **You are a Specialist.** You are a Soldier, a Scholar, a Priest, or a Thief who has the specific skills required to descend into the fog and return with something of value.

### THE CORE LOOP
1.  **THE PREPARE:** You are in Novemgrod, scraping together supplies, trading favors, and accepting contracts from the desperate Factions of the Shelf.
2.  **THE DIVE:** You descend into the Murk. You navigate the silent, fog-choked ruins of the Old Empire. You manage your Oxygen filters, your ammunition, and your Stress.
3.  **THE RETURN:** You climb back up to the light, traumatized but rich. You pay your debts, heal your wounds, and pray you don't have to go back down. (You always have to go back down).

## THE GOLDEN RULES
To survive in The Murk, you must understand three truths:

### 1. SURVIVAL IS EXPENSIVE
There are no free lunches on the Shelf. Clean water costs barter. Bullets cost barter. Even the air you breathe in the Murk costs filter cartridges. If you sit still, you starve. You are forced to adventure not by destiny, but by debt.

### 2. COMBAT IS A FAIL STATE
In other games, combat is the sport. In *The Murk*, combat is what happens when the plan goes wrong. Enemies are lethal, ammunition is scarce, and every wound you take adds to a death spiral of **Suffering**. If you can solve a problem by lying, stealing, or running—do it.

### 3. THE MIND BREAKS BEFORE THE BODY
You have a single health bar called **Stress**. It measures physical damage, but also terror, exhaustion, and magical corruption. A monster might miss you with its claws, but the sheer horror of its presence can fill your Stress track just as fast. When you **Break**, you don't just fall unconscious; you change. You develop phobias, tremors, and addictions. You leave pieces of yourself in the dark.
