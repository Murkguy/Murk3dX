# CHAPTER 4: FOES & ABOMINATIONS

> "If it speaks, shoot it until it stops speaking. If it screams, burn it until it stops screaming." 
> — Field Manual, 4th Legion

In *The Murk*, enemies are divided into two distinct categories:
1.  **FOES:** Humanoid combatants, rival scavengers, and soldiers. They fight with tactics, use cover, and can be broken psychologically.
2.  **ABOMINATIONS:** Creatures of the Murk, undead, and cosmic horrors. They ignore pain, break physics, and cause Stress just by existing.
