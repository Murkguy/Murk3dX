# GRIMUUS (THE DARK BROTHER)

**Status:** Forbidden (in some lands) / Active
**Domains:** War, Trickery, Domination
**Worshippers:** Mercenaries, Assassins, Generals, Warmongers

To the followers of Grimuus, The Great War was not a tragedy; it was the peak of human civilization. The acceleration of technology, the unity of purpose, and the purging of the weak were signs of divine progress. To them, peace is stagnation. They have worked since time immemorial to foment conflict, believing that the world only moves forward when it is bleeding.

## THE THIRD BROTHER HERESY
Certain forbidden scriptures claim that Grimuus is the third and youngest sibling of **Makru** and **Xelas**.

* **The Heresy:** This is anathema to the followers of the Twin Architects, but the logic is difficult to refute. Grimuus works in tandem with Makru to create wars that necessitate higher order (fortifications/weapons), and Xelas’ followers cannot deny that the greatest scientific breakthroughs happen during wartime.
* **The Trinity:** Maker, Thinker, Killer.

## THE TENETS OF CONFLICT
Grimuus is Lawful Evil because he follows a code, but it is a code of wolves.

* **The Engine:** "Man’s nature is that of War. Only through struggle do we move the world forward."
* **The Right:** "To master another is to grow yourself. Domination of the physical or mental is a divine right of the strong."
* **The Dark:** "A world that can be altered in the dark will not return to its light."

## THE WORSHIP
Grimuus is worshipped by those whose lives are defined by violence.

* **The Soldiers:** Mercenaries and Freelancers pay homage for victory.
* **The Spies:** Assassins and Spies make offerings for the success of their "Dark Alterations."
* **The State:** Even respectable Generals in Novemgrod might secretly pour a libation to Grimuus before a campaign, "just to be safe."

## HOLY DAYS
* **The Day of Vendril Fields (January 6th):** A celebration of the defeat of the Great Sultan by a much smaller Imperial force through tactical betrayal.
    * *The Pitfighting:* It is marked by brutal pit-fights where slaves or prisoners battle to the death.
* **The Week of Knives:** Leaders of the world mark this week with extreme caution. It is considered a holy act to murder a King or Prince during this week. If you kill a ruler on Vendril Fields, it is seen as divine proof that they were too weak to rule.
