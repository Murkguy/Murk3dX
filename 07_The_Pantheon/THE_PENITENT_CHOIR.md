# THE PENITENT CHOIR (THE ORPHANS OF LE VIDES)

**Status:** Active / Schismatic Faith
**Domains:** Peace, Grave, Atonement
**Origin:** Pytharis (The Shattered Church of Le Vides)

The Penitent Choir is a religion born from abandonment. Originally the priesthood of Le Vides in Pytharis, they were left broken when their god went silent during the Calamity.

While the rest of Pytharis tries to ignore the silence, the Choir has interpreted it as a divine judgment. They believe Le Vides did not die; he turned his back on humanity because of the cruelty of the War.

## THE TENETS OF GUILT
The Choir believes that the only way to lure their god back is to prove humanity is worth saving.

* **The Burden:** "Man has ruined the world. We must atone through acts of love and suffering."
* **The Calling:** "Every Faith is above the rabble, for the followers are called to their destiny."
* **The Warning:** "Man cannot become Gods. Such hubris dooms the world."

## THE WORKS OF MERCY
Despite their gloomy theology, the Penitent are goodly folk. They run the poor houses in the slums of Novemgrod and Kemet. They are the steadfast guardians of the vulnerable, washing the feet of lepers and feeding the hungry when the Magisters turn away.

## THE SCHISM (FLAGELLANTS)
The reformation has not gone without controversy.

* **The Main Body:** Focuses on acts of charity and singing dirges to the silent sky.
* **The Violent Sects:** The most fervent believe that charity is not enough—only blood can pay the debt. These sects have adopted flagellation ceremonies, whipping themselves in public squares. While considered anathema to the greater faith, their numbers are growing.

## HOLY DAYS
* **Varied:** Because the church shattered, there is no unified calendar. Each sect celebrates (or mourns) on different days, usually marking specific tragedies of the War.
