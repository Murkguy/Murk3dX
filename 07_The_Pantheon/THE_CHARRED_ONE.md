# THE CHARRED ONE

**Status:** Forbidden / Active Cult
**Domains:** Fire, Nihilism, Oblivion

A new god, The Charred One was born not from myth, but from trauma. In the year **3 BC** (Before Calamity), the city of Gavo was consumed by a catastrophic firestorm. From the ashes of that ruin, a voice began to call to the grief-filled, the traumatized, and the mad.

Those who answered made a choice: they refused to rebuild. Instead, they chose to revel in the ashes of what was.

## THE TENETS OF ASH
The Charred believe that all creation is a mistake that must be unmade. Their nihilism is absolute.

* **The Pyre:** "All shall be burned, but the last shall be the arsonists."
* **The Mercy:** "Death is to be welcomed; a gift granted to the weak."
* **The Art:** "Destruction is innately beautiful."

---

## TEMPLES OF RUIN
There are no temples to the Charred One. There are no monuments intentionally built.

* **The Sanctuary:** Their temples are the ruins of other civilizations. A burned-out cathedral or a gutted factory is holy ground.
* **The Congregation:** Followers find no tolerance in any standing city. They gather in the places people have abandoned, collecting themselves before spreading to the four corners of Tellus to enact their Mad God's will.

## THE WAR ON MEMORY
The Cult does not just kill; they erase. They particularly enjoy the destruction of ancient buildings, libraries, and monuments.

* **The Philosophy:** To destroy a monument is to destroy the idea of the past. By eliminating the evidence of what humanity once was, they eliminate the possibility of it ever returning.

## THE HOLY CALENDAR (BRENNDAUER)
The Cult is active year-round, but they have a "High Season" known as **Brenndauer** (The Burning Time). During these months, arson attacks in Novemgrod spike by 300%.

* **The Red Day (May 6th):** The anniversary of the Gavo Firestorm and the birth of their God.
* **Herald’s Day (August 31st):** The anniversary of the Calamity (The Black Day).
