# XELAS (THE SILENT WATCHER)

**Status:** Active / Patron of Scholars & Esoterists
**Domains:** Knowledge, Arcana, The Future
**Relation:** The Younger Twin Brother of Makru

While Makru builds the walls of this world, his younger brother Xelas sits in his high tower, contemplating the next one. Xelas is the God of Knowing, the patron of the Magisters, the Esoterists, and the Advisors.

## THE GRAND DESIGN
Makru focuses on this reality, but Xelas believes this world is merely a draft.

* **The Afterlife:** Xelas questions every soul that passes. He adds their knowledge to his infinite library. If he is impressed by a soul's intellect or discovery, he keeps them in his tower to work on **The Grand Design**—the blueprint for the next reality.
* **The Danger:** This makes Xelas a detached deity. He might allow a tragedy to happen simply to see what data it produces.

## THE TENETS OF INQUIRY
Xelas is not evil, but he is amoral in his pursuit of truth.

* **The Collection:** "Our journey in life is to gather all knowledge we can to better shape the next world."
* **The Open Door:** "No knowledge is forbidden, even what may harm humanity here will surely aid them beyond."
* **The Whisper:** "We are guides to those in power. We must use our reason to push them into Xelas’ heart."

## TEMPLES OF PAPER
Even without dedicated cathedrals, Xelas has holy spaces in nearly every city.

* **The Library:** Every library, archive, and map-room is a temple to Xelas.
* **The Welcome:** His followers are openly welcomed in most cities. A Xelasian Priest is not a preacher; they are a consultant, a scientist, or a Vizier. They are the "Wise Men" standing behind the thrones of the Makru-worshipping Kings.

## HOLY RITES
* **Saturnus (2nd Week of January):** A week of silence. Followers work, eat, and study without speaking a single word, devoting themselves entirely to listening to the thoughts of the god.
* **The Seeking Year (Rite of Passage):** At age 16, a follower is sent out into the world. They cannot return to the temple until they bring back a piece of new information—a map to a lost ruin, a new scientific formula, or a secret stolen from a rival.
