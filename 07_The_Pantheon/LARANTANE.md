## THE WAR OF ROOTS
Two hundred years ago, adventurers from the Vardan Empire encountered the forest. Seeing it as a resource, they attempted to colonize it, sparking a brief but brutal war with the Annirad.

* **The Peace:** The Empire was rebuked by the forest itself. A peace treaty was signed, and word of Longeava spread. Today, it has adherents in lush jungles, deserts, and even the greenhouses of Novemgrod.
* **The Pilgrimage:** Those who follow Longeava are compelled to make a pilgrimage to the Great Tree to be baptized in its nectar.

## THE TENETS OF GROWTH
Longeava is not benevolent; it is vital. It views morality as a human invention that does not apply to biology.

* **The Wind:** "Allow the wind to pass where it may. We watch it, but rarely attempt to change its intent."
* **The Imperative:** "Life must find a way, else nothing matters."
* **The Gardener:** "We are gardeners. We only prune a plant to make the whole thing more beautiful."

## THE GUARDIANS (THE ANNIRAD)
The Annirad have become the protectors of the Elder Forest. They weave magic and force into a shield that protects their living God. There have been numerous attempts to kill or injure the Great Tree by loggers or rival cults; all have been slaughtered.

## THE SEASONAL CYCLES
There are no explicit holy days. Instead, the year is broken into the four biological imperatives.

* **Winter (The Dormant Time):** A time of stillness. Followers shelter in place or travel to where their spring efforts will be needed.
* **Spring (The Growing Time):** The time of love and reproduction. "The Green Folk" engage in acts of ceremonial mating and rejuvenation.
* **Summer (The Basking Time):** Growth is fulfilled. The faithful bask in the bounties of the world.
* **Fall (The Waning Time):** A time of preparation for the end. It is a grim season where Ceremonial Suicides are occasional for those of extreme devotion—offering their bodies as compost to feed the roots of the god during the coming winter.
