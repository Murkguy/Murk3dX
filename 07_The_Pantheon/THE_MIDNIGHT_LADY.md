# THE MIDNIGHT LADY (THE SHADOW OF TURCIA)

**Status:** Active / State Religion (Turcia), Forbidden Cult (West)
**Alignment:** Lawful Evil
**Domains:** Secrets, Trickery, Twilight

In the glittering empire of Turcia, the Golden Lord rules the day. But when the sun sets, the Midnight Lady rules the dark. She is the Counterpart, the Divine Consort, and the Keeper of Truths too dangerous for the light.

She is not a goddess of chaos, but of Control. If the Golden Lord is the Law, the Midnight Lady is the Enforcement.

## THE TENETS OF SILENCE
Her followers believe that civilization requires a dark hand to guide it.

* **The Veil:** "Light blinds; shadow reveals. Only in the dark are we truly ourselves."
* **The Pruning:** "A garden cannot grow if the weeds are not pulled by the root. A whisper is louder than a shout, and a knife in the dark cuts deeper than a sword on the field."
* **The Balance:** "The Sun must set for the stars to rise. We are the stars."

## THE HAND OF THE STATE
In Turcia, her worship is open but quiet.

* **The Temples:** Her shrines are underground, lit only by silver lanterns. They act as "Confessionals" where citizens can report the crimes of their neighbors.
* **The Cult:** Her devoted followers form the **Crescent Blade**—the secret police and spies of the Empire. They are masters of impersonation, poison, and sabotage. They believe that assassinating a corrupt official is a holy act of cleansing.

## THE SAINT OF THIEVES
Outside of Turcia, her worship has mutated. In Novemgrod and the Rungs, she is known as the "Saint of Thieves."

* **The Appeal:** Criminals pray to her not for political stability, but for luck and silence. They leave offerings of stolen silver in the sewers.
* **The Conflict:** The Turcian orthodox church views these foreign thieves as heretics. The Midnight Lady is a goddess of State Secrets, not petty burglary.

## HOLY DAYS
* **The Eclipse:** The holiest event. When the moon obscures the sun, it is the sign that the Lady has taken dominance over her Lord. It is a day of terrifying judgment where enemies of the state vanish without a trace.
* **The Longest Night (Winter Solstice):** A festival of masks. In Turcia, everyone wears a mask for 24 hours. During this time, social hierarchy is suspended, and secrets are exchanged freely, for "faces are lies, but masks tell the truth."
