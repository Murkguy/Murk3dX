# THE CHARRED ONE

**Status:** Forbidden / Active Cult
**Domains:** Fire, Nihilism, Oblivion

A new god, The Charred One was born not from myth, but from trauma. In the year **3 BC** (Before Calamity), the city of Gavo was consumed by a catastrophic firestorm. From the ashes of that ruin, a voice began to call to the grief-filled, the traumatized, and the mad.

Those who answered made a choice: they refused to rebuild. Instead, they chose to revel in the ashes of what was.

---

## THE TENETS OF ASH
The Charred believe that all creation is a mistake that must be unmade. Their nihilism is absolute.

* **The Pyre:** "All shall be burned, but the last shall be the arsonists."
* **The Mercy:** "Death is to be welcomed; a gift granted to the weak."
* **The Art:** "Destruction is innately beautiful."

---

## TEMPLES OF RUIN
There are no temples to the Charred One. There are no monuments intentionally built.

* **The Sanctuary:** Their temples are the ruins of other civilizations. A burned-out cathedral or a gutted factory is holy ground.
* **The Congregation:** Followers find no tolerance in any standing city. They gather in the places people have abandoned, collecting themselves before spreading to the four corners of Tellus to enact their Mad God's will.

---

## THE WAR ON MEMORY
The Cult does not just kill; they erase. They particularly enjoy the destruction of ancient buildings, libraries, and monuments.

* **The Philosophy:** To destroy a monument is to destroy the idea of the past. By eliminating the evidence of what humanity once was, they eliminate the possibility of it ever returning.

---

## THE HOLY CALENDAR (BRENNDAUER)
The Cult is active year-round, but they have a "High Season" known as **Brenndauer** (The Burning Time). During these months, arson attacks in Novemgrod spike by 300%.

* **The Red Day (May 6th):** The anniversary of the Gavo Firestorm and the birth of their God.
* **Herald’s Day (August 31st):** The anniversary of the Calamity (The Black Day).

# THE NINE MOTHERS (THE WEAVERS OF ANGKREBYORN)

**Status:** Active / Ancient
**Native Name:** The Äitienuja (The Mother-Streams)

Far to the North, atop the frozen peaks of Mount Angkrebyorn, dwell the Nine Mothers. They are not beings of flesh and blood, but colossal, elemental matriarchs formed from the ice, the wind, and the stone of the steppe.

They are the Fates of the Suomi. They do not rule; they watch. They do not judge; they weave. To the Nine Mothers, every life is merely a thread in a tapestry that stretches back to the beginning of time.

---

## THE TENETS OF THE WEAVE
The Mothers are not nurturing in the human sense. They are the "Cold Love" that teaches a child to survive the winter.

* **The Pattern:** "The world is neither cruel nor wonderful. It simply is. The tapestry is already woven; we merely walk the pattern."
* **The Vessel:** "We are beasts designed to feel. Pain is the needle, and Pleasure is the thread. Both are necessary to bind the soul."
* **The Current:** "The wind does not care where it blows, but the wise woman sets her sail to catch it."

---

## THE LISTENERS (THE CHILDREN OF FATE)
While the Mothers do not interfere with man’s world, they influence those who listen.

* **The Pilgrimage:** Those who ascend Mount Angkrebyorn do not find a temple; they find the **Whispering Winds**. The Mothers speak to their minds in a language of concepts, not words. A single message from a Mother may take years to fully articulate in the mind of a mortal.
* **The Role:** The Listeners act as vessels of fate. They are vagabonds and drifters, often distrusted, because they operate on a timeline only they can hear. A Listener might stand motionless on a street corner for three days simply because "The Third Mother said the rain must hit my shoulder at this exact moment."

---

## HOLY OCCURRENCES
* **Red Sunsets:** When the sky bleeds red, the veil between the Mothers and the valleys is thin. It is said that during a Red Sunset, you can ask a question to the wind and hear the answer before the sun dies.
* **The Long Twilight (December):** The time of the "Waking." The Suomi Shamans (**Noaidi**) ascend the mountain to offer tribute, ensuring the Mothers do not cut the threads of the tribes during the harsh winter.

# MAKRU (THE GOLDEN LAW)

**Status:** Active / Patron of Rulers & Builders
**Domains:** Forge, Order, Authority
**Major Center of Worship:** Turcia (State Religion), Novemgrod (Guilds)

Makru is the Eldest of the Twin Brothers, the eminent builder who constructed the eternal Towers in which his younger sibling, Xelas, rests. He is the divine patron of civilization itself—the force that separates the City from the Wild.

---

## THE DIVINE RIGHT
Makru is the god of Kings. Many Princes and Lords across the Shelf trace their right to rule back to a singular historical event called **The Dictate of Makru**.

* **The Legend:** In the ancient world, Makru granted the "Right to Rule" to 12 Adventurers. The descendants of these twelve form the Great Houses that still dominate the politics of Doria, Ruthenia, and Pytharis today. To disobey a Lord is to disobey Makru.

---

## THE TENETS OF IRON
Makru is not a merciful deity; he is a just one. He demands diligence, and he despises entropy.

* **The Forge of Will:** "We are the craftsmen of our own reality. It is the force of will that leads man to his destiny."
* **The Static Order:** "We cannot allow the defiance of fate or the natural order."
* **The Tool:** "As the craftsman, we must always seek out new tools in which to forge our will."

---

## TEMPLES OF INDUSTRY
Makru has many ornate temples, but they look more like fortresses. His followers use stone as a display of power. Every castle, bunker, and city wall in the Near Lands likely bears the Icon of Makru (The Hammer or The Gear) upon its keystone.

### THE ETERNAL ENEMY
Makru is the great enemy of **The Charred One**. One seeks to build; the other seeks to burn.
* **The Conflict:** Makru’s followers (The Order of the Hammer) actively hunt Charred Cultists. It is a war of construction versus arson. In Novemgrod, if a factory burns down, the Makru Priesthood will hunt the culprit with terrifying efficiency.

---

## HOLY DAYS
* **Hammermass (April 14th):** A holy week of creation. It concludes with a celebratory display of the week's labor—parades of new machines, unveiling of statues, and demonstrations of architectural prowess.
* **Recitation Day (November 5th):** A somber day, enforced by law in Turcia and by custom in noble houses elsewhere. All citizens must publicly recite their oaths of loyalty to their Lords and Masters.

# XELAS (THE SILENT WATCHER)

**Status:** Active / Patron of Scholars & Esoterists
**Domains:** Knowledge, Arcana, The Future
**Relation:** The Younger Twin Brother of Makru

While Makru builds the walls of this world, his younger brother Xelas sits in his high tower, contemplating the next one. Xelas is the God of Knowing, the patron of the Magisters, the Esoterists, and the Advisors.

---

## THE GRAND DESIGN
Makru focuses on this reality, but Xelas believes this world is merely a draft.

* **The Afterlife:** Xelas questions every soul that passes. He adds their knowledge to his infinite library. If he is impressed by a soul's intellect or discovery, he keeps them in his tower to work on **The Grand Design**—the blueprint for the next reality.
* **The Danger:** This makes Xelas a detached deity. He might allow a tragedy to happen simply to see what data it produces.

---

## THE TENETS OF INQUIRY
Xelas is not evil, but he is amoral in his pursuit of truth.

* **The Collection:** "Our journey in life is to gather all knowledge we can to better shape the next world."
* **The Open Door:** "No knowledge is forbidden, even what may harm humanity here will surely aid them beyond."
* **The Whisper:** "We are guides to those in power. We must use our reason to push them into Xelas’ heart."

---

## TEMPLES OF PAPER
Even without dedicated cathedrals, Xelas has holy spaces in nearly every city.

* **The Library:** Every library, archive, and map-room is a temple to Xelas.
* **The Welcome:** His followers are openly welcomed in most cities. A Xelasian Priest is not a preacher; they are a consultant, a scientist, or a Vizier. They are the "Wise Men" standing behind the thrones of the Makru-worshipping Kings.

---

## HOLY RITES
* **Saturnus (2nd Week of January):** A week of silence. Followers work, eat, and study without speaking a single word, devoting themselves entirely to listening to the thoughts of the god.
* **The Seeking Year (Rite of Passage):** At age 16, a follower is sent out into the world. They cannot return to the temple until they bring back a piece of new information—a map to a lost ruin, a new scientific formula, or a secret stolen from a rival.

# LONGEAVA (THE GREAT TREE)

**Status:** Active / Living Deity
**Domains:** Nature, Life, Cycles
**Region:** The Elder Forest (Southern Shelf)

Longeava is the name given to the Great Tree, a colossal botanical entity worshipped by the Annirad, an ancient tribe residing in the forested south. For centuries, they communed with the Tree in isolation, learning from its longevity.

---

## THE WAR OF ROOTS
Two hundred years ago, adventurers from the Vardan Empire encountered the forest. Seeing it as a resource, they attempted to colonize it, sparking a brief but brutal war with the Annirad.

* **The Peace:** The Empire was rebuked by the forest itself. A peace treaty was signed, and word of Longeava spread. Today, it has adherents in lush jungles, deserts, and even the greenhouses of Novemgrod.
* **The Pilgrimage:** Those who follow Longeava are compelled to make a pilgrimage to the Great Tree to be baptized in its nectar.

---

## THE TENETS OF GROWTH
Longeava is not benevolent; it is vital. It views morality as a human invention that does not apply to biology.

* **The Wind:** "Allow the wind to pass where it may. We watch it, but rarely attempt to change its intent."
* **The Imperative:** "Life must find a way, else nothing matters."
* **The Gardener:** "We are gardeners. We only prune a plant to make the whole thing more beautiful."

---

## THE GUARDIANS (THE ANNIRAD)
The Annirad have become the protectors of the Elder Forest. They weave magic and force into a shield that protects their living God. There have been numerous attempts to kill or injure the Great Tree by loggers or rival cults; all have been slaughtered.

---

## THE SEASONAL CYCLES
There are no explicit holy days. Instead, the year is broken into the four biological imperatives.

* **Winter (The Dormant Time):** A time of stillness. Followers shelter in place or travel to where their spring efforts will be needed.
* **Spring (The Growing Time):** The time of love and reproduction. "The Green Folk" engage in acts of ceremonial mating and rejuvenation.
* **Summer (The Basking Time):** Growth is fulfilled. The faithful bask in the bounties of the world.
* **Fall (The Waning Time):** A time of preparation for the end. It is a grim season where Ceremonial Suicides are occasional for those of extreme devotion—offering their bodies as compost to feed the roots of the god during the coming winter.

# THE PENITENT CHOIR (THE ORPHANS OF LE VIDES)

**Status:** Active / Schismatic Faith
**Domains:** Peace, Grave, Atonement
**Origin:** Pytharis (The Shattered Church of Le Vides)

The Penitent Choir is a religion born from abandonment. Originally the priesthood of Le Vides in Pytharis, they were left broken when their god went silent during the Calamity.

While the rest of Pytharis tries to ignore the silence, the Choir has interpreted it as a divine judgment. They believe Le Vides did not die; he turned his back on humanity because of the cruelty of the War.

---

## THE TENETS OF GUILT
The Choir believes that the only way to lure their god back is to prove humanity is worth saving.

* **The Burden:** "Man has ruined the world. We must atone through acts of love and suffering."
* **The Calling:** "Every Faith is above the rabble, for the followers are called to their destiny."
* **The Warning:** "Man cannot become Gods. Such hubris dooms the world."

---

## THE WORKS OF MERCY
Despite their gloomy theology, the Penitent are goodly folk. They run the poor houses in the slums of Novemgrod and Kemet. They are the steadfast guardians of the vulnerable, washing the feet of lepers and feeding the hungry when the Magisters turn away.

---

## THE SCHISM (FLAGELLANTS)
The reformation has not gone without controversy.

* **The Main Body:** Focuses on acts of charity and singing dirges to the silent sky.
* **The Violent Sects:** The most fervent believe that charity is not enough—only blood can pay the debt. These sects have adopted flagellation ceremonies, whipping themselves in public squares. While considered anathema to the greater faith, their numbers are growing.

---

## HOLY DAYS
* **Varied:** Because the church shattered, there is no unified calendar. Each sect celebrates (or mourns) on different days, usually marking specific tragedies of the War.

# GRIMUUS (THE DARK BROTHER)

**Status:** Forbidden (in some lands) / Active
**Domains:** War, Trickery, Domination
**Worshippers:** Mercenaries, Assassins, Generals, Warmongers

To the followers of Grimuus, The Great War was not a tragedy; it was the peak of human civilization. The acceleration of technology, the unity of purpose, and the purging of the weak were signs of divine progress. To them, peace is stagnation. They have worked since time immemorial to foment conflict, believing that the world only moves forward when it is bleeding.

---

## THE THIRD BROTHER HERESY
Certain forbidden scriptures claim that Grimuus is the third and youngest sibling of **Makru** and **Xelas**.

* **The Heresy:** This is anathema to the followers of the Twin Architects, but the logic is difficult to refute. Grimuus works in tandem with Makru to create wars that necessitate higher order (fortifications/weapons), and Xelas’ followers cannot deny that the greatest scientific breakthroughs happen during wartime.
* **The Trinity:** Maker, Thinker, Killer.

---

## THE TENETS OF CONFLICT
Grimuus is Lawful Evil because he follows a code, but it is a code of wolves.

* **The Engine:** "Man’s nature is that of War. Only through struggle do we move the world forward."
* **The Right:** "To master another is to grow yourself. Domination of the physical or mental is a divine right of the strong."
* **The Dark:** "A world that can be altered in the dark will not return to its light."

---

## THE WORSHIP
Grimuus is worshipped by those whose lives are defined by violence.

* **The Soldiers:** Mercenaries and Freelancers pay homage for victory.
* **The Spies:** Assassins and Spies make offerings for the success of their "Dark Alterations."
* **The State:** Even respectable Generals in Novemgrod might secretly pour a libation to Grimuus before a campaign, "just to be safe."

---

## HOLY DAYS
* **The Day of Vendril Fields (January 6th):** A celebration of the defeat of the Great Sultan by a much smaller Imperial force through tactical betrayal.
    * *The Pitfighting:* It is marked by brutal pit-fights where slaves or prisoners battle to the death.
* **The Week of Knives:** Leaders of the world mark this week with extreme caution. It is considered a holy act to murder a King or Prince during this week. If you kill a ruler on Vendril Fields, it is seen as divine proof that they were too weak to rule.

# THE MIDNIGHT LADY (THE SHADOW OF TURCIA)

**Status:** Active / State Religion (Turcia), Forbidden Cult (West)
**Alignment:** Lawful Evil
**Domains:** Secrets, Trickery, Twilight

In the glittering empire of Turcia, the Golden Lord rules the day. But when the sun sets, the Midnight Lady rules the dark. She is the Counterpart, the Divine Consort, and the Keeper of Truths too dangerous for the light.

She is not a goddess of chaos, but of Control. If the Golden Lord is the Law, the Midnight Lady is the Enforcement.

---

## THE TENETS OF SILENCE
Her followers believe that civilization requires a dark hand to guide it.

* **The Veil:** "Light blinds; shadow reveals. Only in the dark are we truly ourselves."
* **The Pruning:** "A garden cannot grow if the weeds are not pulled by the root. A whisper is louder than a shout, and a knife in the dark cuts deeper than a sword on the field."
* **The Balance:** "The Sun must set for the stars to rise. We are the stars."

---

## THE HAND OF THE STATE
In Turcia, her worship is open but quiet.

* **The Temples:** Her shrines are underground, lit only by silver lanterns. They act as "Confessionals" where citizens can report the crimes of their neighbors.
* **The Cult:** Her devoted followers form the **Crescent Blade**—the secret police and spies of the Empire. They are masters of impersonation, poison, and sabotage. They believe that assassinating a corrupt official is a holy act of cleansing.

---

## THE SAINT OF THIEVES
Outside of Turcia, her worship has mutated. In Novemgrod and the Rungs, she is known as the "Saint of Thieves."

* **The Appeal:** Criminals pray to her not for political stability, but for luck and silence. They leave offerings of stolen silver in the sewers.
* **The Conflict:** The Turcian orthodox church views these foreign thieves as heretics. The Midnight Lady is a goddess of State Secrets, not petty burglary.

---

## HOLY DAYS
* **The Eclipse:** The holiest event. When the moon obscures the sun, it is the sign that the Lady has taken dominance over her Lord. It is a day of terrifying judgment where enemies of the state vanish without a trace.
* **The Longest Night (Winter Solstice):** A festival of masks. In Turcia, everyone wears a mask for 24 hours. During this time, social hierarchy is suspended, and secrets are exchanged freely, for "faces are lies, but masks tell the truth."
